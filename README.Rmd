# abstractsHostParasites

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this R package abstractsHostParasites is to hold tools for generate
text classification models and process data asociated with this task.


## Installation

You can install the development version of abstractsHostParasites from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alrobles/abstractsHostParasites")
```
## Acplication case
The main goals of this project is to have a model that given an abstract
can classify if this abstrac belongs to a specific category.

An application case is to consider articles related to host-parasite interactions from open databases. In we case we get refered citations
in [Zover](http://www.mgc.ac.cn/cgi-bin/ZOVER/main.cgi) and Glogal mammal parasite database [GMPD](https://gmpd2.ecology.uga.edu/)


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(abstractsHostParasites)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
