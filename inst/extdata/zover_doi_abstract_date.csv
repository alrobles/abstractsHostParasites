1,10.1638/2019-0063,DETECTION OF SKUNK ADENOVIRUS 1 IN TWO NORTH AMERICAN PORCUPINES (ERETHIZON DORSATUM) WITH RESPIRATORY DISEASE,"Adenoviruses have been reported to affect a broad range of host species, tend to be species specific, and often affect the respiratory system. This report describes the isolation of an adenovirus from deep nasal swabs of two wild North American porcupines ( Erethizon dorsatum ) with respiratory diseases that presented to a wildlife hospital. Partial sequences of the deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase gene of the isolated virus were identical to skunk adenovirus (SkAdV-1), also known as pygmy marmoset adenovirus. Both porcupines survived and were released back to the wild after successful medical treatment and rehabilitation. The significance of the adenovirus isolated from these porcupines is unknown; however, this is the first report of an adenovirus in porcupines, and the first report of SkAdV-1 in a rodent.",2020,1,9,zover

In contrast to the over 70 adenovirus types isolated from humans, few rodent adenoviruses are known, despite the vast diversity of rodent species. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to investigate adenovirus diversity in wild rodents and shrews in Cameroon. Adenovirus DNA was detected in 13.8% of animals (n = 218). All detected sequences differ from known adenovirus types by more than 10% at the amino acid level, thus indicating up to 14 novel adenovirus species. These results highlight the diversity of rodent adenoviruses, their phylogeny, and opportunities for studying alternative adenovirus rodent models.",2019,6,25,zover

Using a virus screening pipeline based on a pan-viral DNA microarray with downstream next-generation sequencing a novel squirrel-associated virus was identified with mastadenovirus-typical sequence elements. Phylogenetic analysis of hexon protein amino acid sequences demonstrated the highest similarity to Equine adenovirus (AdV) 2, but a strong divergence to a squirrel AdV from Korea and other rodent AdVs. Shorter hexon gene segment investigations confirmed a close relationship with other squirrel-derived AdVs from Europe. The novel virus species was tentatively designated as Squirrel Adenovirus-1.",2017,7,6,zover

The sequence defines the 204 amino acid proteinase, which apparently does not possess the usual L3 polyadenylation signal, but instead the sequence AAATAA. This gene is followed by a 147 amino acid C-terminal portion of the DNA-binding protein, encoded by the complementary strand.",1992,2,NA,zover
5,10.1016/j.virusres.2011.05.023,Genomic and phylogenetic analyses of murine adenovirus 2,"Murine adenoviruses (MAdV) are supposedly the oldest members of the genus Mastadenovirus. Currently, there are three distinct MAdV types known with rather different tropism and pathology. Here we report and annotate the DNA sequence of the full genome of MAdV-2. It was found to consist of 35,203 bp thus being considerably larger than the genomes of the other two MAdV types. The increased size of the MAdV-2 genome is generally due to larger genes and ORFs, although some differences in the number of ORFs were observed for the early regions E1, E3 and E4. The homologue of the 19K gene of E1B from MAdV-2 codes for 330 amino acids (aa) and is almost twice as large as from other mastadenoviruses. Accordingly, only the N-terminal half (155aa) has homology to the 19K protein. A homologue of the gene of the 12.5K protein was identified in the E3 region of MAdV-2, but not in MAdV-1 or MAdV-3. The other gene of yet unknown function in the E3 region of MAdV-2 seems to be unique. The E4 region of MAdV-2 contains three ORFs. One has similarity to the 34K gene of other AdVs. Two unique ORFs in the E4 region of MAdV-2 have no homology to any of the five and six ORFs in the E4 region of MAdV-1 or MAdV-3, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the three murine AdVs have a close common ancestor. They likely formed the first branching of the lineage of mastadenoviruses, and seem to be the most ancient representatives of this genus.",2011,9,NA,zover
6,10.1371/journal.ppat.1002218,The Fecal Viral Flora of Wild Rodents,"The frequent interactions of rodents with humans make them a common source of zoonotic infections. To obtain an initial unbiased measure of the viral diversity in the enteric tract of wild rodents we sequenced partially purified, randomly amplified viral RNA and DNA in the feces of 105 wild rodents (mouse, vole, and rat) collected in California and Virginia. We identified in decreasing frequency sequences related to the mammalian viruses families Circoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Adenoviridae, and Coronaviridae. Seventeen small circular DNA genomes containing one or two replicase genes distantly related to the Circoviridae representing several potentially new viral families were characterized. In the Picornaviridae family two new candidate genera as well as a close genetic relative of the human pathogen Aichi virus were characterized. Fragments of the first mouse sapelovirus and picobirnaviruses were identified and the first murine astrovirus genome was characterized. A mouse papillomavirus genome and fragments of a novel adenovirus and adenovirus-associated virus were also sequenced. The next largest fraction of the rodent fecal virome was related to insect viruses of the Densoviridae, Iridoviridae, Polydnaviridae, Dicistroviriade, Bromoviridae, and Virgaviridae families followed by plant virus-related sequences in the Nanoviridae, Geminiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Secoviridae, Partitiviridae, Tymoviridae, Alphaflexiviridae, and Tombusviridae families reflecting the largely insect and plant rodent diet. Phylogenetic analyses of full and partial viral genomes therefore revealed many previously unreported viral species, genera, and families. The close genetic similarities noted between some rodent and human viruses might reflect past zoonoses. This study increases our understanding of the viral diversity in wild rodents and highlights the large number of still uncharacterized viruses in mammals.",2011,9,1,zover

To explore the epidemiological characteristics of rodent and shrew AdVs in southern China, 255 fecal samples derived from four rodent species and 90 from shrews were collected in Xiamen and Guangzhou city of southern China. Amplification of a 314-324-bp fragment from the DNA polymerase gene of AdVs was attempted by using a nested PCR. Twenty-nine (11.4Â %) specimens from rodents and one (1.1Â %) specimen from shrews were tested positive for AdVs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that nine samples from Rattus norvegicus in Guangzhou city between 2012 and 2013 might be the genuine AdV of R. norvegicus. The same putative AdV sequences were derived from samples of different host species from different/same places. A novel adenovirus was detected in Suncus murinus Linnaeus (SML/14GDGZ72) for the first time. Our findings provide new data on the prevalence and diversity of AdVs in rodents and shrews.",2016,3,15,zover

They have a widespread geographical dissemination and infect several species, including red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris). In the Iberian Peninsula, there are no reports of infection of red squirrels by AdV. In this study, we report for the first time the detection of squirrel AdV in a red squirrel trapped in central Portugal. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences obtained for the hexon and the penton base genes were similar to the Korean squirrel AdV strain and strongly divergent from the strains present in red squirrels in Europe. These findings indicate the emergence of a new strain circulating in Europe and raise concerns regarding the conservation of the red squirrel.",2020,6,3,zover
11,10.3389/fmicb.2021.653873,"Detection of Virus-Related Sequences Associated With Potential Etiologies of Hepatitis in Liver Tissue Samples From Rats, Mice, Shrews, and Bats","Hepatitis is a major global health concern. However, the etiology of 10-20% hepatitis cases remains unclear. Some hepatitis-associated viruses, like the hepatitis E virus, are zoonotic pathogens. Rats, shrews, and bats are reservoirs for many zoonotic pathogens. Therefore, understanding the virome in the liver of these animals is important for the investigation of the etiologies of hepatitis and monitoring the emerging zoonotic viruses. In this study, viral metagenomics and PCR methods were used to investigate viral communities in rats, mice, house shrews, and bats livers. Viral metagenomic analysis showed a diverse set of sequences in liver samples, comprising: sequences related to herpesviruses, orthomyxoviruses, anelloviruses, hepeviruses, hepadnaviruses, flaviviruses, parvoviruses, and picornaviruses. Using PCR methods, we first detected hepatovirus sequences in  Hipposideros larvatus  (3.85%). We also reported the first detection of Zika virus-related sequences in rats and house shrews. Sequences related to influenza A virus and herpesviruses were detected in liver. Higher detection rates of pegivirus sequences were found in liver tissue and serum samples from rats (7.85% and 15.79%, respectively) than from house shrews. Torque teno virus sequences had higher detection rates in the serum samples of rats and house shrews (52.72% and 5.26%, respectively) than in the liver. Near-full length genomes of pegivirus and torque teno virus were amplified. This study is the first to compare the viral communities in the liver of bats, rats, mice, and house shrews. Its findings expand our understanding of the virome in the liver of these animals and provide an insight into hepatitis-related viruses.",2021,6,8,zover

They have been found in many vertebrate hosts including primates. In this study, we describe the application of the high-throughput sequencing to examine the frequency and diversity of anelloviruses in rodents, bats and opossums captured in SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil. We report a total of twenty-six anelloviruses with sixteen nearly complete genomes and ten partial genomes, which include eleven potential novel species identified in rodents (Cricetidae), bats (Molossidae and Phyllostomidae), and opossums (Didelphidae). We also propose the inclusion of two potential new genera within the Anelloviridae family, provisionally named Omegatorquevirus and Sigmatorquevirus, including six and three novel species of anelloviruses, respectively. In summary, this study expands the diversity and the host range of the known anelloviruses.",2018,1,NA,zover
13,10.1016/j.virol.2018.01.017,Detection and phylogenetic analysis of torque teno virus (TTV) carried by murine rodents and house shrews in China,"Between May 2015 and May 2017, 496 animals (473 murine rodents and 23 house shrews) were captured in six regions of China. A total of 22.8% (113/496) of throat swabs, 29.1% (142/488) of fecal samples and 23.8% (54/227) of serum samples tested positive for rodent torque teno virus 3 (RoTTV3). The positive rate in Rattus norvegicus was higher than the rate in Rattus tanezumi and Rattus losea. Of 23 house shrews, one throat swab and one serum sample were positive for RoTTV3. Ten murine rodents were simultaneously positive for RoTTV3 in throat swab, fecal and serum samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 12 near-full length genomes of RoTTVs sequences obtained in this study represented a novel RoTTV genotype (RoTTV3). In conclusion, high prevalence rates of RoTTV3 were found in three common murine rodents in China, and the RoTTV3 obtained in this study were classified as a novel genotype of RoTTV.",2018,3,NA,zover
14,10.1038/s41426-018-0089-y,An epizootic of <i>Chlamydia psittaci</i> equine reproductive loss associated with suspected spillover from native Australian parrots,"Chlamydia psittaci is an avian pathogen capable of spill-over infections to humans. A parrot C. psittaci strain was recently detected in an equine reproductive loss case associated with a subsequent cluster of human C. psittaci infections. In this study, we screened for C. psittaci in cases of equine reproductive loss reported in regional New South Wales, Australia during the 2016 foaling season. C. psittaci specific-PCR screening of foetal and placental tissue samples from cases of equine abortion (nâ€‰=â€‰161) and foals with compromised health status (nâ€‰=â€‰38) revealed C. psittaci positivity of 21.1% and 23.7%, respectively. There was a statistically significant geographical clustering of cases ~170â€‰km inland from the mid-coast of NSW (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Genomic analysis and molecular typing of C. psittaci positive samples from this study and the previous Australian equine index case revealed that the equine strains from different studs in regional NSW were clonal, while the phylogenetic analysis revealed that the C. psittaci strains from both Australian equine disease clusters belong to the parrot-associated 6BC clade, again indicative of spill-over of C. psittaci infections from native Australian parrots. The results of this work suggest that C. psittaci may be a more significant agent of equine reproductive loss than thought. A range of studies are now required to evaluate (a) the exact role that C. psittaci plays in equine reproductive loss; (b) the range of potential avian reservoirs and factors influencing infection spill-over; and",2018,5,16,zover
16,10.1371/journal.pone.0141952,New Type of Papillomavirus and Novel Circular Single Stranded DNA Virus Discovered in Urban Rattus norvegicus Using Circular DNA Enrichment and Metagenomics,"Rattus norvegicus (R. norvegicus) are ubiquitous and their presence has several effects on the human populations in our urban areas on a global scale. Both historically and presently, this close interaction has facilitated the dissemination of many pathogens to humans, making screening for potentially zoonotic and emerging viruses in rats highly relevant. We have investigated faecal samples from R. norvegicus collected from urban areas using a protocol based on metagenomic enrichment of circular DNA genomes and subsequent sequencing. We found a new type of papillomavirus, with a L1 region 82% identical to that of the known R. norvegicus Papillomavirus 2. Additionally, we found 20 different circular replication associated protein (Rep)-encoding single stranded DNA (CRESS-DNA) virus-like genomes, one of which has homology to the replication-associated gene of Beak and feather disease virus. Papillomaviruses are a group of viruses known for their carcinogenic potential, and although they are known to infect several different vertebrates, they are mainly studied and characterised in humans. CRESS-DNA viruses are found in many different environments and tissue types. Both papillomaviruses and CRESS-DNA viruses are known to have pathogenic potential and screening for novel and known viruses in R. norvegicus could help identify viruses with pathogenic potential.",2015,11,11,zover
17,10.1007/s00705-016-3004-7,Molecular detection and genome characterization of porcine circovirus type 2 in rats captured on commercial swine farms,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is considered the major etiological pathogen of porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVADs) in pigs. Recently, PCV2 was also found in non-porcine animals such as cattle, rats, and mice. However, there was no record of PCV2 in rats in China. The goal of this study was to investigate whether PCV2 was present in rats (Rattus norvegicus, RN) on three swine farms, using molecular tools. PCR results showed that 30 of 95 (31.6Â %) rat samples were positive for PCV2. Moreover, further genotype analysis suggested that 10 of 30 (33.3Â %) were positive for PCV2a, 19 of 30 (63.3Â %) were positive for PCV2b, and only one sample (1/30, 3.33Â %) was co-infected by PCV2a and PCV2b. To determine the possible origin of PCV2, 60 serum samples were also collected from weaned pigs on those swine farms, and 23 out of 60 samples were positive for PCV2. In addition, two distinct RN-origin and two distinct porcine-origin PCV2 full-length nucleotide sequences were obtained from the farms. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis indicated that they had the highest nucleotide similarity and closest genetic relationships to each other. In this study, we report the infection and genome characterization of PCV2 in rats and compare RN-origin and porcine-origin PCV2 sequences obtained from the same pig farm, revealing possible cross-species transmission of PCV2.",2016,8,16,zover

19,10.1007/s00705-016-2762-6,High genetic structuring of Tula hantavirus,"Tula virus (TULV) is a vole-associated hantavirus with low or no pathogenicity to humans. In the present study, 686 common voles (Microtus arvalis), 249 field voles (Microtus agrestis) and 30 water voles (Arvicola spec.) were collected at 79 sites in Germany, Luxembourg and France and screened by RT-PCR and TULV-IgG ELISA. TULV-specific RNA and/or antibodies were detected at 43 of the sites, demonstrating a geographically widespread distribution of the virus in the studied area. The TULV prevalence in common voles (16.7 %) was higher than that in field voles (9.2 %) and water voles (10.0 %). Time series data at ten trapping sites showed evidence of a lasting presence of TULV RNA within common vole populations for up to 34 months, although usually at low prevalence. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a strong genetic structuring of TULV sequences according to geography and independent of the rodent species, confirming the common vole as the preferential host, with spillover infections to co-occurring field and water voles. TULV phylogenetic clades showed a general association with evolutionary lineages in the common vole as assessed by mitochondrial DNA sequences on a large geographical scale, but with local-scale discrepancies in the contact areas.",2016,1,30,zover

To map the risk areas for hantavirus transmission we carried out a study based on rodent trapping and determined the anti-hantavirus seroprevalence in these animals and in the inhabitants of these localities. Overall seroprevalence in rodents and humans were 2.5% and 2.4%, respectively. Eighty-two percent of the seropositive rodents were genetically analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that hantaviruses from rodent samples cluster with AraucÃ¡ria (Juquitiba-like) or JaborÃ¡ hantavirus genotypes. The JaborÃ¡ strain was identified in Akodon serrensis and Akodon montensis, whereas the AraucÃ¡ria strain was detected in Oligoryzomys nigripes, Oxymycterus judex, A. montensis, and Akodon paranaensis, with the latter species being identified for the first time as a natural host.

22,10.1006/viro.2000.0630,Genetic Diversity of Hantaviruses Isolated in China and Characterization of Novel Hantaviruses Isolated from Niviventer confucianus and Rattus rattus,"The antigenic and genetic properties of 46 hantaviruses from China, 13 from patients, 23 from rodents, and 10 from unknown hosts, were compared with those of other hantaviruses. The viruses were classified as either Hantaan (HTN) or Seoul (SEO) viruses. A phylogenetic analysis of the partial M (300 bp) and S (around 485 bp) genomes of HTN viruses identified nine distinct genetic subtypes, one consisting of isolates from Korea. The SEO viruses were divided into five genetic subtypes, although they had less variability than the HTN subtypes. There was a correlation between the subtype and province of origin for four subtypes of HTN viruses, confirming geographical clustering. Hantaan virus NC167 isolated from Niviventer confucianus and SEO virus Gou3 isolated from Rattus rattus were the basal clades in each virus. The phylogenetic trees constructed from the entire S and M segments suggested that NC167 was introduced to N. confucianus in a host-switching event. The reactivity of a panel of 35 monoclonal antibodies was almost exactly the same in NC167 and a representative HTN virus and in Gou3 and a representative SEO virus. However, there was a one-way cross-neutralization between them. These results confirm the varied nature of Murinae-associated hantaviruses in China.",2000,12,NA,zover
23,10.1292/jvms.11-0567,Studies on Hantavirus Infection in Small Mammals Captured in Southern and Central Highland Area of Vietnam,"To investigate the distribution of hantaviruses among animals in Southern and Central Highland area of Vietnam, a total of 1311 serum samples were obtained from rats and Asian house shrews (Suncus murinus) captured at 11 locations between 2006 and 2009. A total of 1066 serum samples from rats were examined for IgG antibodies against Hantaan virus, and there were 30 antibody-positive serum samples from rats that had been captured mainly in a port area and urban area in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) (2.8%). All of the antibody-positive rats were Rattus norvegicus, and they had Seoul virus (SEOV) genome in their lungs. SEOV sequences detected from rats captured in Southern Vietnam belonged to the same lineage as those from rats captured at Haiphong Port and a market area in Hanoi City. SEOV strain CSG5 was isolated from a rat captured at Saigon Harbor. Strain CSG5 showed a cross-neutralization pattern almost the same as that of a representative strain of SEOV. A total of 245 Asian house shrews were captured in the Central Highland area and near HCMC. Sera were examined for IgG antibodies against Thottapalayam virus (TPMV), and 32 (13.1%) of the antibody-positive shrews were mainly from the Central Highland area and showed a neutralizing antibody against TPMV.

Several viruses have been associated with human cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome often through peridomestic exposure. Jabora (JABV) and Juquitiba (JUQV), harbored by Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys nigripes, respectively, are endemic and sympatric in the Reserva Natural de Bosque MbaracayÃº (RNBM), Paraguay, a protected area of the Interior Atlantic Forest. Rodent communities were surveyed along a 30 km stretch of the RNBM in eight vegetation classifications (Low, High, Bamboo, Riparian and Liana Forests, Bamboo Understory, Cerrado, and Meadow/Grasslands). We collected 417 rodents from which 11 species were identified; Akodon montensis was the predominant species (72%; 95%CI: 64.7%-76.3%), followed by Hylaeamys megacephalus (15% (11.2%-18.2%)) and Oligoryzomys nigripes (9% (6.6%-12.4%)). We examined the statistical associations among habitat (vegetation class) type, rodent species diversity, population structure (age, sex, and weight), and prevalence of RBO-HV antibody and/or viral RNA (Ab/RNA) or characteristic Leishmania tail lesions. Ab/RNA positive rodents were not observed in Cerrado and Low Forest. A. montensis had an overall Ab/RNA prevalence of 7.7% (4.9%-11.3%) and O. nigripes had an overall prevalence of 8.6% (1.8%-23.1%). For A. montensis, the odds of being Ab/RNA positive in High Forest was 3.73 times of the other habitats combined. There was no significant difference among age classes in the proportion of Ab/RNA positive rodents overall (p = 0.66), however, all 11 RNA-positive individuals were adult. Sex and habitat had independent prognostic value for hantaviral Ab/RNA in the study population; age, presence of tail scar/lesion (19% of the rodents) and weight did not.

26,10.1128/jvi.76.8.3765-3773.2002,Analysis of Hantavirus Genetic Diversity in Argentina: S Segment-Derived Phylogeny,"Nucleotide sequences were determined for the complete S genome segments of the six distinct hantavirus genotypes from Argentina and for two cell culture-isolated Andes virus strains from Chile. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that, although divergent from each other, all Argentinian hantavirus genotypes group together and form a novel phylogenetic clade with the Andes virus. The previously characterized South American hantaviruses Laguna Negra virus and Rio Mamore virus make up another clade that originates from the same ancestral node as the Argentinian/Chilean viruses. Within the clade of Argentinian/Chilean viruses, three subclades can be defined, although the branching order is somewhat obscure. These are made of (i) ""Lechiguanas-like"" virus genotypes, (ii) Maciel virus and Pergamino virus genotypes, and (iii) strains of the Andes virus. Two hantavirus genotypes from Brazil, Araraquara and Castello dos Sonhos, were found to group with Maciel virus and Andes virus, respectively. The nucleocapsid protein amino acid sequence variability among the members of the Argentinian/Chilean clade does not exceed 5.8%. It is especially low (3.5%) among oryzomyine species-associated virus genotypes, suggesting recent divergence from the common ancestor. Interestingly, the Maciel and Pergamino viruses fit well with the rest of the clade although their hosts are akodontine rodents. Taken together, these data suggest that under conditions in which potential hosts display a high level of genetic diversity and are sympatric, host switching may play a prominent role in establishing hantavirus genetic diversity. However, cospeciation still remains the dominant factor in the evolution of hantaviruses.",2002,4,15,zover

Using PCR approaches, partial virus genome sequences were obtained from 5 human sera, and spleens from 5 Calomys laucha rodents from the outbreak area. Genetic analysis revealed a newly discovered hantavirus, Laguna Negra (LN) virus, to be associated with the HPS outbreak and established a direct genetic link between the virus detected in the HPS cases and in the C. laucha rodents, implicating them as the primary rodent reservoir for LN virus in Paraguay. Virus isolates were obtained from two C. laucha, and represent the first successful isolation of a pathogenic South American hantavirus. Analysis of the prototype LN virus entire S and M and partial L segment nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences showed that this virus is unique among the Sigmodontinae-borne clade of hantaviruses. Analysis of PCR fragments amplified from a serum sample from a Chilean HPS patient, who had recently traveled extensively in Bolivia (where C. laucha are known to occur), revealed an LN virus variant that was approximately 15% different at the nucleotide level and identical at the deduced amino acid level relative to the Paraguayan LN virus. These data suggest that LN virus may cause HPS in several countries in this geographic region.",1997,11,NA,zover
30,10.1006/viro.2001.0983,"Genetic Identification and Characterization of Limestone Canyon Virus, a Unique Peromyscus-Borne Hantavirus","Hantaviruses, family Bunyaviridae, are rodent-borne RNA viruses that can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in various regions of the Americas. A coevolutionary relationship exists between hantaviruses and their specific rodent reservoir hosts; the phylogeny of the viruses generally matches that of the rodents. There are several Peromyscus-borne hantaviruses, including Sin Nombre virus, the most common cause of HPS in North America. This report describes the genetic detection and characterization of a newly discovered Peromyscus boylii-borne virus, Limestone Canyon (LSC) virus, the most divergent member of the Peromyscus-borne hantaviruses to date. Analysis of a 1209-nucleotide region of the S segment of LSC virus showed it to be more closely related to hantaviruses found in harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis and R. mexicanus) than to other Peromyscus-associated hantaviruses (Sin Nombre, New York, and Monongahela). Phylogenetic analysis of virtually the entire M genome segment (3489 nucleotides) of LSC virus revealed a similar picture in which LSC virus was found to be very distinct from other Peromyscus-associated viruses, but its exact relationship to the other Peromyscus-borne and the Reithrodontomys-borne viruses was not resolved. These results indicate that hantavirus host species-jumping events can occur by which a hantavirus may switch to, and become established in, a rodent host belonging to a different genus. P. boylii are present throughout the southwestern United States and central Mexico. More extensive screening of HPS patients by using RT-PCR assays will be necessary to determine if LSC virus can cause human disease.",2001,8,NA,zover

35,10.1089/vbz.2013.1504,Multiple Infections of Rodents with Zoonotic Pathogens in Austria,"Rodents are important reservoirs for a large number of zoonotic pathogens. We examined the occurrence of 11 viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents in rodent populations in Austria, including three different hantaviruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, orthopox virus, Leptospira spp., Borrelia spp., Rickettsia spp., Bartonella spp., Coxiella burnetii, and Toxoplasma gondii. In 2008, 110 rodents of four species (40 Clethrionomys glareolus, 29 Apodemus flavicollis, 26 Apodemus sylvaticus, and 15 Microtus arvalis) were trapped at two rural sites in Lower Austria. Chest cavity fluid and samples of lung, spleen, kidney, liver, brain, and ear pinna skin were collected. We screened selected tissue samples for hantaviruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, orthopox viruses, Leptospira, Borrelia, Rickettsia, Bartonella spp., C. burnetii, and T. gondii by RT-PCR/PCR and detected nucleic acids of Tula hantavirus, Leptospira spp., Borrelia afzelii, Rickettsia spp., and different Bartonella species. Serological investigations were performed for hantaviruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, orthopox viruses, and Rickettsia spp. Here, Dobrava-Belgrade hantavirus-, Tula hantavirus-, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-, orthopox virus-, and rickettsia-specific antibodies were demonstrated. Puumala hantavirus, C. burnetii, and T. gondii were neither detected by RT-PCR/PCR nor by serological methods. In addition, multiple infections with up to three pathogens were shown in nine animals of three rodent species from different trapping sites. In conclusion, these results show that rodents in Austria may host multiple zoonotic pathogens. Our observation raises important questions regarding the interactions of different pathogens in the host, the countermeasures of the host's immune system, the impact of the host-pathogen interaction on the fitness of the host, and the spread of infectious agents among wild rodents and from those to other animals or humans.",2014,7,NA,zover

Small mammals were collected using Sherman live capture traps and transported to Korea University where they were euthanized, tissues removed, and assayed to determine hantavirus IgG antibody-positive and hantavirus-positive rates by RT-PCR. A total of 2,364 small mammals were captured over 11,300 trap nights (capture rate = 20.92%). Apodemus agrarius was the most commonly collected (76.65%), with capture rates of 9.62% and 21.70% for Cp Humphreys and the expansion site, respectively. Overall, Hantaan virus (HTNV) IgG antibody-positive (Ab+) rate for A. agrarius was 2.15% (39/1,812).

Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful technology to define genomic sequences of the viruses. Of particular interest is the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to perform phylogeographic analysis, that allows the detection and tracking of the emergence of viral infections. Hantaviruses, Bunyaviridae, cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans. We propose to use WGS for the phylogeographic analysis of human hantavirus infections. A novel multiplex PCR-based NGS was developed to gather whole genome sequences of Hantaan virus (HTNV) from HFRS patients and rodent hosts in endemic areas. The obtained genomes were described for the spatial and temporal links between cases and their sources. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated geographic clustering of HTNV strains from clinical specimens with the HTNV strains circulating in rodents, suggesting the most likely site and time of infection. Recombination analysis demonstrated a genome organization compatible with recombination of the HTNV S segment. The multiplex PCR-based NGS is useful and robust to acquire viral genomic sequences and may provide important ways to define the phylogeographical association and molecular evolution of hantaviruses.",2016,5,25,zover

HTNV is a major causative for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) with fatality rates ranging from 1% to 15% in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and China. Defining of HTNV whole-genome sequences and isolation of the infectious particle play a critical role in the characterization and preventive and therapeutic strategies of hantavirus outbreaks. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides an advanced tool for massive genomic sequencing of viruses. However, the isolation of viral infectious particles is a huge obstacle to investigate and develop anti-virals for hantaviruses. Here, we report 12 HTNV isolates from lung tissues of the striped field mouse in the highly HFRS-endemic areas. Sequence-independent, single-primer amplification (SISPA) NGS was attempted to recover the genomic sequences of HTNV isolates. The nucleotide sequence of HTNV S, M, and L segments were covered up to 99.4-100%, 97.5-100%, and 95.6-99.8%, respectively, based on the full length of the prototype HTNV 76-118. The whole-genome sequencing of HTNV isolates was accomplished by additional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification cDNA ends (RACE) PCR.

In humans, orthohantavirus infection causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Whole-genome sequencing of the virus helps in identification and characterization of emerging or re-emerging viruses. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a potent method to sequence the viral genome, using molecular enrichment methods, from clinical specimens containing low virus titers. Hence, a comparative study on the target enrichment NGS methods is required for whole-genome sequencing of orthohantavirus in clinical samples. In this study, we used the sequence-independent, single-primer amplification, target capture, and amplicon NGS for whole-genome sequencing of Hantaan orthohantavirus (HTNV) from rodent specimens. We analyzed the coverage of the HTNV genome based on the viral RNA copy number, which is quantified by real-time quantitativeÂ PCR. Target capture and amplicon NGS demonstrated a high coverage rate of HTNV in Apodemus agrarius lung tissues containing up to 10 3 -10 4  copies/Î¼L of HTNV RNA.

Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of PUUV circulating in local populations of its rodent reservoir host, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) during eight years. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of all three genome segments of PUUV showed strong geographical structuring at a very local scale. There was a high temporal turnover of virus strains in the local bank vole populations, but several virus strains persisted through multiple years. Phylodynamic analyses showed no significant changes in the local effective population sizes of PUUV, although vole numbers and virus prevalence fluctuated widely. Microsatellite data demonstrated also a temporally persisting subdivision between local vole populations, but these groups did not correspond to the subdivision in the virus strains.

In addition, we present sequence information for the M segment of Thailand virus and demonstrate that it represents a unique, fifth branch on the dendrogram. We show that a tree nearly identical to that constructed from the deduced amino acids encoded in the M segments of these viruses can be constructed by comparing nucleotide sequences of a 333-bp region of the M segments of the same hantaviruses. This region can be amplified, for most hantaviruses, by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques, using a single primer pair. By using this method, we constructed a consensus tree for 30 hantaviruses, including 15 isolates for which we PCR-amplified and sequenced the 333-bp region. In addition to the five branches described above, we identified a sixth unique hantavirus group represented by Dobrava virus, an Apodemus isolate from Slovenia. Although we were unable to PCR-amplify the M segment of Thottapalayam virus, a distantly related hantavirus isolated from a shrew captured in India, we were able to amplify, clone, and sequence a portion of the small (S) segment of that virus.

Nucleotide sequences were determined for the complete S and M and partial L genomic segments of a BCC virus isolate. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that each of the virus segments is unique, and there is no evidence of genetic reassortment having occurred between this and other previously characterized hantaviruses. All hantavirus-seropositive, wild-caught Sigmodon hispidus which were tested by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of BCC virus RNA were found to be positive, consistent with a chronic virus infection. This finding, together with serologic evidence, confirms S. hispidus as the primary rodent reservoir of this virus. Nucleotide sequence analysis of these PCR products indicates that BCC virus is genetically diverse and may pose a public health threat throughout much of the extensive range of this rodent species. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the presence of G1-, G2-, and N-specific antibodies in sera from BCC virus-infected patients with HPS and naturally infected S. hispidus. Comparison of the patterns of protein immunoprecipitation obtained with human acute- and convalescent-phase sera suggests that G1- and G2-specific antibodies increase relative to N-specific antibodies during the course of infection.

In addition to the natural rodent reservoir, Clethrionomys glareolus, Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) could infect colonized Microtus agrestis and Lemmus sibiricus, but not Syrian hamsters or Balb/C mice. Neither C. glareolus, nor M. agrestis, could be readily infected by Tula hantavirus (TULV). Wild-trapped Apodemus flavicollis and A. agrarius, the natural reservoirs of Dobrava (DOBV) and Saaremaa (SAAV) hantaviruses, respectively, could both be infected by SAAV. NMRI mice could also be infected by SAAV, but with lower efficiency as compared to Apodemus mice. Balb/C and NMRI laboratory mice, but not C. glareolus, could be infected by DOBV. To our knowledge, this is the first time DOBV and SAAV have been shown to infect adult laboratory mice. Moreover, potential hantavirus spillover infections were investigated in wild-trapped rodents. In addition to the natural host C. glareolus, we also found M. arvalis and A. sylvaticus with a history of PUUV infection. We did not find any C. glareolus or A. sylvaticus infected with TULV, a hantavirus which is known to circulate in the same geographical regions of Belgium.",2002,10,10,zover

72,10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.003,Puumala hantavirus genetic variability in an endemic region (Northern Sweden),"Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), naturally harboured and shed by bank voles (Myodes [Clethrionomys] glareolus), is the etiological agent to nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Both host and virus are found throughout much of the European continent and in northern Sweden NE is the second most prevalent serious febrile viral infection after influenza. The reliability of diagnostics by PCR depends on genetic variability for the detection of viral nucleic acids in unknown samples. In the present study we evaluated the genetic variability of PUUV isolated from bank voles in an area of northern Sweden highly endemic for NE. Genetic variability among bank voles was also investigated to evaluate co-evolutionary patterns. We found that the viral sequence appeared stable across the 80km study region, with the exception of the southernmost sampling site, which differed from its nearest neighbour by 7%, despite a geographical separation of only 10km. The southernmost sampling site demonstrated a higher degree of genetic similarity to PUUV previously isolated 100km south thereof; two locations appear to constitute a separate PUUV phylogenetic branch. In contrast to the viral genome, no phylogenetic variance was observed in the bank vole mtDNA in this study. Previous studies have shown that as a result of terrestrial mammals' postglacial re-colonization routes, bank voles and associated PUUV of a southern and a northern lineage established a dichotomous contact zone across the Scandinavian peninsula approximately 100-150km south of the present study sites. Our observations reveal evolutionary divergence of PUUV that has led to dissimilarities within the restricted geographical scale of the northern host re-colonization route as well. These results suggest either a static situation in which PUUV strains are regionally well adapted, or an ongoing process in which strains of PUUV circulate on a geographical scale not yet reliably described.",2008,5,NA,zover
73,10.1089/153036602760260742,Genetic Evidence for Tula Virus in<i>Microtus arvalis</i>and<i>Microtus agrestis</i>Populations in Croatia,"To determine the threat of hantavirus infection to U.S. Forces, small mammals were sampled from training areas within Croatia. Of the 152 samples, 20 were positive for Tula virus (TUL), 12 common voles (Microtus arvalis) and eight field voles (Microtus agrestis). Sequences from M. agrestis were found in five and sequences from M. arvalis were found in six of seven sequence groups. The high percentage of the same TUL sequences in M. agrestis and M. arvalis suggests the co-occurrence of this virus in both Microtus species is not an accident. If M. agrestis field voles were accidentally infected with TUL, the percentage of polymerase chain reaction-positive animals should be lower than that of M. arvalis. Because the infection rate in M. arvalis (11.8%) was less than half of that found in M. agrestis (27.6%), it is unlikely that the predominance of positive M. agrestis could be due to accidental exposure. It is much more likely that the Croatian virus is circulating between both rodent species.",2002,3,NA,zover
74,10.1006/viro.1995.1552,Coexistence of Several Novel Hantaviruses in Rodents Indigenous to North America,"Three genetically distinct members of the Hantavirus genus have been detected in Nevada rodents by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequence analysis. These include Sin Nombre (SN), El Moro Canyon (ELMC), and Prospect Hill (PH)-like viruses which are primarily associated with Peromyscus maniculatus (deer mouse), Reithrodontomys megalotis (western harvest mouse), and Microtus spp. (voles), respectively. Although this region of the United States is ecologically diverse, rodents infected with different hantaviruses appear to coexist in several different geographical and ecological zones. In two widely separated states, Nevada and North Dakota, PH-like viruses are present in three different species of vole. In addition, ELMC-like virus has been detected in both R. megalotis and M. montanus (mountain vole). SN virus is a cause of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome throughout much of the United States. SN virus RNA is found in 12.5% of P. maniculatus in Nevada and eastern California. Two lineages of SN virus coexist in this region and differ from SN viruses originally found in infected rodents in New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado. These data show the complexity of hantavirus maintenance in rodents. Distinct hantaviruses or virus lineages can coexist either in different or the same rodent species and in either different or the same geographic or ecological zones.",1995,10,NA,zover
75,10.1006/viro.1995.0071,Naturally Occurring Sin Nombre Virus Genetic Reassortants,"Genetic reassortment has been shown to play an important role in the evolution of several segmented RNA viruses and in the epidemiology of associated diseases. Sin Nombre (SN) virus is the cause of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome throughout the western United States. Like other hantaviruses, it possesses a genome consisting of three negative-sense RNA segments, S, M, and L. Recent analysis has demonstrated the presence of at least three different hantaviruses in Nevada and eastern California, including SN, Prospect Hill-like, and El Moro Canyon-like viruses. In addition, two distinct lineages of SN virus can be found in Peromyscus maniculatus rodents (sometimes in close proximity) trapped at study sites in this region. Data obtained by phylogenetic analysis of sequence differences detected among the S, M, and L genome segments of these SN viruses are consistent with reassortment having taken place between SN virus genetic variants. The results suggest that M (and to a lesser extent S or L) genome segment flow occurs within SN virus populations in P. maniculatus in this region. No reassortment was detected between SN virus and other hantavirus types present in the area. This finding suggests that as genetic distance increases, the frequency of formation of viable reassortants decreases, or that hantaviruses which are primarily maintained in different rodent hosts rarely have the opportunity to genetically interact.",1995,12,NA,zover

In late 1999 and early 2000, an outbreak of acute illness compatible with HPS was reported in Los Santos, Panama, with the death of 3 of the 12 (25%) suspected cases. Hantavirus-specific antibodies were detected in patient sera, and virus RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of virus genome N-, G1-, and G2-encoding fragments showed this to be a novel hantavirus, Choclo virus. Serologic and virus genetic analyses of rodents trapped in the area showed Oligoryzomys fulvescens to be the likely reservoir for the HPS-associated Choclo virus.

The isolates, Convict Creek 107 and 74 (CC107 and CC74) are genetically similar to viruses known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in New Mexico. CC107 and CC74 each have an M segment consisting of 3696 nucleotides with a coding potential of 1140 amino acids in the virus complementary-sense RNA (cRNA). The S segments of CC107 and CC74 are 2083 and 2047 nucleotides long, respectively, and each has an ORF in the cRNA capable of encoding a protein of 428 amino acids. Unusually long 3' noncoding regions of 757 and 721 nucleotides follow the S segment ORF of CC107 and CC74, respectively, and include numerous imperfect repetitive sequences. Whereas the M and S segments of any given hantavirus typically appear to diverge at comparable rates from homologous genes of any other hantavirus, CC107 and CC74 have M segments that differ by only 1% from one another but S segments that differ by 13%. After trivial explanations are rendered improbable, i.e., by consideration of the genetics of closely and distantly related hantaviruses, the most likely explanation for our data is that hantavirus genome segment reassortment occurred within rodent populations in California.",1995,2,NA,zover
78,10.1093/molbev/msn093,High Rates of Molecular Evolution in Hantaviruses,"Hantaviruses are rodent-borne Bunyaviruses that infect the Arvicolinae, Murinae, and Sigmodontinae subfamilies of Muridae. The rate of molecular evolution in the hantaviruses has been previously estimated at approximately 10(-7) nucleotide substitutions per site, per year (substitutions/site/year), based on the assumption of codivergence and hence shared divergence times with their rodent hosts. If substantiated, this would make the hantaviruses among the slowest evolving of all RNA viruses. However, as hantaviruses replicate with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, with error rates in the region of one mutation per genome replication, this low rate of nucleotide substitution is anomalous. Here, we use a Bayesian coalescent approach to estimate the rate of nucleotide substitution from serially sampled gene sequence data for hantaviruses known to infect each of the 3 rodent subfamilies: Araraquara virus (Sigmodontinae), Dobrava virus (Murinae), Puumala virus (Arvicolinae), and Tula virus (Arvicolinae). Our results reveal that hantaviruses exhibit short-term substitution rates of 10(-2) to 10(-4) substitutions/site/year and so are within the range exhibited by other RNA viruses. The disparity between this substitution rate and that estimated assuming rodent-hantavirus codivergence suggests that the codivergence hypothesis may need to be reevaluated.",2008,4,3,zover

The rodents were trapped in all the explored environments, and most of the seropositive rodents were found in habitats frequented by humans. Nucleotide sequences were obtained from four HPS case-patients and four yellow pygmy rice rats of the M genome segment. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis showed that rodent-borne viruses and viruses from three HPS case-patients form a well-supported clade and share a 96.4% identity with the previously characterized Central Plata hantavirus. These results suggest that yellow pygmy rice rat (O. flavescens) may be the host for Central Plata, a hantavirus associated with HPS in the southern area of Uruguay.",2003,7,NA,zover

In this study, a total of 523 bank voles (408 from Germany, 72 from Slovakia, and 43 from Czech Republic) collected between the years 2007-2012 were analyzed for the presence of hantavirus RNA. Partial PUUV genome segment sequences were obtained from 51 voles. Phylogenetic analyses of all three genome segments showed that the newfound strains cluster with other Central and Western European PUUV strains. The new sequences from Å umava (Bohemian Forest), Czech Republic, are most closely related to the strains from the neighboring Bavarian Forest, a known hantavirus disease outbreak region. Interestingly, the Slovak strains clustered with the sequences from Bohemian and Bavarian Forests only in the M but not S segment analyses. This well-supported topological incongruence suggests a segment reassortment event or, as we analyzed only partial sequences, homologous recombination. Our data highlight the necessity of sequencing all three hantavirus genome segments and of a broader bank vole screening not only in recognized endemic foci but also in regions with no reported human hantavirus disease cases.",2017,6,29,zover

Eighteen animals, all Clethrionomys species, were antigen positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Small and medium genome segments were recovered by RT-PCR from six samples from Clethrionomys glareolus and three from Clethrionomys rufocanus. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these hantaviruses were Puumala virus and were similar to hantavirus strains from Finland. To confirm these data, partial nucleotide sequences of the rodent hosts' cytochrome b genes were obtained, as well as several sequences from genes from rodents trapped at different localities of European Russia and western Siberia. The cytochrome b sequences of Siberian bank voles were similar to sequences of C. glareolus, trapped in Finland. These data suggest that the Puumala hantaviruses, as well as their rodent hosts, share a common evolutionary history.

In addition, three PUUV isolates originating from bank voles trapped in the 1980s in southern (Montbliart) and northern (Turnhout) Belgium were genetically characterized. Analysis of the complete S and partial M segment sequences showed that the Belgian PUUV strains constitute a genetic lineage, distinct from other known PUUV lineages from Europe and Japan. This lineage also includes a wild strain (Cg-Erft) originating from a neighbouring area of Germany. Within the Belgian lineage, geographical clustering of genetic variants was observed. In the Montbliart site, the range of diversity between the most temporally distant strains (from 1986 and 1996-1998) was higher than between those from 1996 and 1998, suggesting slight genetic drift via accumulation of neutral or quasi-neutral substitutions with time.",2001,4,NA,zover

In addition, serum sample was collected from one patient. Virus isolation was attempted from human serum and rodent samples. Four hantaviruses were isolated successfully in cell culture from one human, two A. agrarius, and one R. norvegicus. The nucleotide sequences for the entire S and M and partial L segment were determined from these four isolates as well as six viruses isolated in 1980s. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the S segment from all isolates belong to the Hantaan virus (HTNV) clade, regardless of the sources from which they were derived. According to the S sequences, these viruses could be divided into three distinct phylogroups, showing geographical clustering. Analysis of the entire M and the partial L segment sequences demonstrated that 8 out of the 10 isolates belong to the HTNV clade. However, two isolates (CGRn8316 and CGRn9415) isolated from R. norvegicus belong to the Seoul virus (SEOV) clade. In addition, these two isolates were distinct from other known members of SEOV clade. Together, the data suggest that at least three groups of HTNV are co-circulating and one new variant of SEOV may be present in Guizhou. Our results also suggest that HTNV from A. agrarius spilled over to R. norvegicus and natural reassortment between HTNV and SEOV occurred during or after the spillover.",2008,NA,NA,zover

Tula virus (TULV), a European hantavirus, is believed to be slightly or non-pathogenic in humans and was initially detected in the common vole Microtus arvalis, the East European vole M. levis (formerly rossiaemeridionalis), and subsequently in other Microtus species. Here we report the first multiple RT-PCR detection and sequence analyses of TULV in the Eurasian water vole Arvicola amphibius from different regions in Germany and Switzerland. Additional novel TULV S-, M-, and L-segment sequences were obtained from M. arvalis and M. agrestis trapped in Germany at sites close to trapping sites of TULV-RT-PCR-positive water voles. Serological investigations using a recombinant TULV nucleocapsid protein revealed the presence of TULV-reactive antibodies in RT-PCR-positive and a few RT-PCR-negative water voles. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a geographical clustering of the novel S-, M-, and L-segment sequences from A. amphibius with those of M. arvalis- and M. agrestis-derived TULV lineages, and may suggest multiple TULV spillover or a potential host switch to A. amphibius.

Baoji, located in the Guanzhong Plain in the central part of Shaanxi Province, has been severely affected by HFRS since its first emergence in 1955. To better understand the epidemiology of orthohantaviruses infection in humans and the causative agents carried by the rodents, the long-term incidence patterns were analyzed and a molecular epidemiological investigation of orthohantaviruses infection in humans and rodents was performed. During 1984-2019, 13,042 HFRS cases were registered in Baoji, including 275 death cases. Except the first high prevalence of HFRS in 1988-1993, another two epidemic peaks were observed in 1998-2003 and 2012, respectively, although vaccination project was started since 1996. During the same period, HFRS cases in Baoji mainly were recorded in winter suggesting they may be caused by Hantaan orthohantavirus (HTNV), while a small peak of HFRS was also found in summer with unknown reason. Nucleotide identity and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that a novel clade of HTNV sequences recovered from HFRS cases were closely related to those from rodents, including species close contact with humans, suggesting a direct viral transmission from rodents to humans and the important role in the HTNV transmission the nontraditional rodent hosts may play. Moreover, two distant related Dabieshan orthohantavirus (DBSV) lineages were also identified in Niviventer niviventer in this area demonstrating its considerable genetic diversity.

More HFRS cases have been reported in Cixi than in Wenzhou. Annual incidence rate of HFRS in Cixi had been on the level of approximately 1.5/100,000 from 1968 (when the first HFRS case was reported) to 2007, with the highest incidence rate of 8.54/100,000 in 1999. The annual incidence rate in Wenzhou has been relatively low, less than 0.5/100,000 since the first HFRS case was reported in 1981.

Interestingly, hantavirus antigens were identified in 6 of 196 (3.06%) Suncus murinus. Genetic analysis showed that partial M and S segment sequences recovered from rats in the two regions belong to Seoul virus (SEOV) and can be assigned into two genetic lineages. SEOV variants that belong to these two lineages of viruses are distributed widely in China and have been found outside China.

Tula orthohantavirus (TULV) is widely distributed throughout the European continent in its reservoir, the common vole (Microtus arvalis), but the virus was also frequently detected in field voles (Microtus agrestis) and other vole species. TULV and common voles are absent from Great Britain. However, field voles there harbor Tatenale and Kielder hantaviruses. Here we screened 126 field voles and 13 common voles from Brandenburg, Germany, for hantavirus infections. One common vole and four field voles were anti-TULV antibody and/or TULV RNA positive.

The partial S and L segment nucleotide sequences were only 61.1% and 75.6% identical to sympatrically occurring TULV sequences, but showed highest similarity of approximately 80% to British Tatenale and Kielder hantaviruses. Subsequent determination of the entire nucleocapsid (N), glycoprotein (GPC), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoding sequences and determination of the pairwise evolutionary distance (PED) value for the concatenated N and GPC amino acid sequences confirmed a novel orthohantavirus species, tentatively named Traemmersee orthohantavirus.

Seven potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites were identified in the M segment gene product, one in the G2 and six in the G1 coding regions. The S segment is 1667 nucleotides long, and has a single ORF in the cRNA capable of encoding a protein of 428 amino acids. Phylogenetic comparisons of the M and S segments of DOB virus to those of other hantaviruses indicated that DOB virus is similar to, but clearly distinct from Hantaan (HTN) and Seoul (SEO) viruses. Certain G2-specific, but not G1-specific monoclonal antibodies to HTN virus reacted to the same titre with DOB and homologous viral antigen. Plaque-reduction neutralization tests indicated that, of the sera tested, only antisera to SEO virus were able to neutralize DOB virus to a titre greater than 1:10; however, this neutralization titre was eightfold lower than that observed with homologous SEO virus. The data reported here confirm that DOB virus is a unique species in the Hantavirus genus, family Bunyaviridae.",1995,11,1,zover

HFRS is caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV), Seoul virus (SEOV), Dobrava virus (DOBV), Saaremaa virus (SAAV), and Puumala virus (PUUV). Of those, only HTNV is not present in Europe. In recent years, hantaviruses, described in other parts of Europe, were also detected at various locations in Hungary. To study the genetic properties of Hungarian hantaviruses in detail, sequences of the viral S and M segments were recovered from bank voles (Myodes glareolus), yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis), and striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) trapped in the Transdanubian region. As expected, the sequences recovered belonged, respectively, to PUUV (two strains), DOBV (one strain), and SAAV (one strain). On phylogenetic trees two new Hungarian PUUV strains located within the well- supported Alpe-Adrian (ALAD) genetic lineage that included also Austrian, Slovenian, and Croatian strains. Analysis of the Hungarian SAAV and DOBV genetic variants showed host-specific clustering and also geographical clustering within each of these hantavirus species. Hungarian SAAV and DOBV strains were related most closely to strains from Slovenia (Prekmurje region). This study confirms that multiple hantaviruses can co-circulate in the same locality and can be maintained side-by-side in different rodent species.",2009,12,NA,zover

The S, M, and L segments of the Greek isolate of Dobrava virus are 1673, 3635, and 6532 nucleotides (nt) long, respectively, and encode the nucleocapsid (N) protein of 429 amino acids (aa), glycoprotein precursor of 1135 aa, and the L protein of 2151 aa. N protein contains three cysteine residues conserved in all known hantaviruses, as well as structural domains responsible for the RNA binding and presumable interaction with the apoptosis enhancer Daxx. All cysteine residues and glycosylation sites that are conserved among G1G2 sequences of all hantaviruses species were also found in the Greek isolate. The L protein contains all the polymerase motifs and structural domains found in other hantavirus polymerases. Comparison of the Greek isolate of Dobrava virus with other hantaviruses showed the highest level of sequence homology with Dobrava virus isolate from Slovenia. Other hantaviruses carried by Murinae rodents (Saaremaa, Hantaan, Seoul, and Thailand viruses) were more divergent and hantaviruses carried by Arvicolinae or Sigmodontinae rodents showed the highest genetic diversity with the Greek isolate of Dobrava. The results of phylogenetic analyses confirmed these observations and showed a monophily of all the Dobrava virus strains that, in turn, shared more ancient ancestors first with Saaremaa virus and then with other Murinae-borne hantaviruses.",2003,1,13,zover

All three hantaviruses are now found in Croatia. Lung tissue samples of 315 Apodemus mice trapped in 2003-2004 were screened for the presence of hantaviral N-Ag and 20 mice (6.3%) were found either strongly positive or weak/suspected-positive. Partial sequences of hantavirus M and S segments were recovered by RT-PCR from six mice and subjected to (phylo)genetic analysis that revealed the presence of four novel strains of DOBV and one of SAAV. Curiously, one of the newly described DOBV strains was found in Apodemus agrarius mouse, that is, not in the traditional host, A. flavicollis mice, suggesting a spillover event. S segment sequences recovered previously from HFRS cases [MarkotiÄ‡ et al., 2002] were confirmed as DOBV sequences; one of which appeared particularly close to the prototype Slovenian DOBV isolate. Taken together with earlier data on PUUV in Croatia, these results show a co-circulation of three European hantavirus pathogens in this country. So far, not a single SAAV sequence has been recovered from HFRS patients either in Croatia or neighboring Slovenia and Hungary nor in Slovakia suggesting a somewhat lower fequency of acute SAAV infection in humans in this part of Europe than for example in the Baltics.",2010,11,24,zover

In this study, we investigated hantaviruses and, for the first time, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Rickettsia spp. in small wild rodents from two different sites (mountainous and lowland region) in Croatia. In total, 194 transudate and tissue samples from 170 rodents (A. flavicollis, n=115; A. agrarius, n=2; Myodes glareolus, n=53) were tested for antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence assays (IIFT) and for nucleic acids by conventional (hantaviruses) and real-time RT-/PCRs (TBEV and Rickettsia spp.). A total of 25.5% (24/94) of the rodents from the mountainous area revealed specific antibodies against hantaviruses. In all, 21.3% (20/94) of the samples from the mountainous area and 29.0% (9/31) from the lowland area yielded positive results for either Puumala virus (PUUV) or Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) using a conventional RT-PCR. All processed samples (n=194) were negative for TBEV by IIFT or real-time RT-PCR. Serological evidence of rickettsial infection was detected in 4.3% (4/94) rodents from the mountainous region. Another 3.2% (3/94) rodents were positive for Rickettsia spp. by real-time PCR. None of the rodents (n=76) from the lowland area were positive for Rickettsia spp. by real-time PCR. Dual infection of PUUV and Rickettsia spp. was found in one M. glareolus from the mountainous area by RT-PCR and real-time PCR, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of Rickettsia spp. in small rodents from Croatia. Phylogenetic analyses of S- and M-segment sequences obtained from the two study sites revealed well-supported subgroups in Croatian PUUV and DOBV.

We investigated seroprevalence to selected groups of rodent-borne viruses among human populations with high levels of animal exposure and among co-located rodent populations. The indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was used to determine seropositivity to representative reference strains of hantaviruses (Dobrava virus [DOBV], Seoul virus [SEOV]), cowpox virus, arenaviruses (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV]), flaviviruses (tick-borne encephalitis virus [TBEV]), and rodent parechoviruses (Ljungan virus), using sera from 245 humans living in Dong Thap Province and 275 rodents representing the five common rodent species sold in wet markets and present in peridomestic and farm settings. Combined seropositivity to DOBV and SEOV among the rodents and humans was 6.9% (19/275) and 3.7% (9/245), respectively; 1.1% (3/275) and 4.5% (11/245) to cowpox virus; 5.4% (15/275) and 47.3% (116/245) for TBEV; and exposure to Ljungan virus was 18.8% (46/245) in humans, but 0% in rodents. Very little seroreactivity was observed to LCMV in either rodents (1/275, 0.4%) or humans (2/245, 0.8%). Molecular screening of rodent liver tissues using consensus primers for flaviviruses did not yield any amplicons, whereas molecular screening of rodent lung tissues for hantavirus yielded one hantavirus sequence (SEOV). In summary, these results indicate low to moderate levels of endemic hantavirus circulation, possible circulation of a flavivirus in rodent reservoirs, and the first available data on human exposures to parechoviruses in Vietnam. Although the current evidence suggests only limited exposure of humans to known rodent-borne diseases, further research is warranted to assess public health implications of the rodent trade.",2015,1,NA,zover

It is caused by several hantavirus species hosted by small rodents. We describe spatial and temporal patterns of HFRS incidence in the Russian Federation, and the geographic distribution of prevalent hantavirus species: Puumala (PUUV) and Dobrava (DOBV). Partial sequencing of nucleocapsid and glycoprotein genes of 117 PUUV strains and 78 DOBV strains revealed several distinct genetic subgroups. The RNA of Volga PUUV subgroup was detected in patients with HFRS and bank voles Myodes glareolus in the Volga Federal District, where the highest HFRS incidence rate has been registered yearly. The RNA of Siberian PUUV subgroup was found in M. glareolus in the trans-Ural Tyumen and Omsk Provinces, where human HFRS cases have been rare. During an HFRS outbreak in 2007 in the Central Federal District, when more than 1000 patients were affected, specific subgroups of DOBV were discovered in patients and rodents, mainly in the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius. DOBV strains might have 8â€“9% of nucleotide difference although they were collected at places separated by 30â€“100 km. The RNA of a unique DOBV subgroup was discovered in the southern semi-desert Astrakhan Province, mainly in A. agrarius and tamarisk jird Meriones tamariscinus. No human HFRS cases were diagnosed in this province. Russian PUUV and DOBV strains have no close homologues among European strains. Our DOBV strains might be genetically grouped together with Central European DOBV strains isolated from A. agrarius, but not from Apodemus flavicollis. The Volga PUUV subgroup is to some extent similar to Baltic PUUV strain, and Finnish PUUV strains resemble the strains from the Siberian PUUV subgroup. Thus, PCRbased monitoring and typing provided the opportunity to delineate and expand the area of hantaviruses in Russia and to identify their new genetic variants.",2009,8,NA,zover

To study the potential risk of natural hantavirus infection of non-human primates, we investigated serum samples from non-human primates of three species living in outdoor enclosures of the German Primate Center (GPC), GÃ¶ttingen, located in a hantavirus endemic region of central Germany. For that purpose we used serological assays based on recombinant antigens of the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) transmitted Puumala virus (PUUV) and the common and field vole (Microtus arvalis, Microtus agrestis) associated Tula virus (TULV) which are both broadly geographically distributed in Germany. In 24 out of 251 (9.6%) monkey sera collected in 2006 PUUV- and/or TULV-reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected. Investigation of follow-up sera from 13 animals confirmed for two animals a seroconversion due to hantavirus exposure at the GPC. To prove the origin of the infection, wild rodents from the surrounding regions were analyzed by hantavirus-specific reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. In 6 of the 73 investigated bank voles and 3 of the 19 investigated Microtus spp. PUUV- and TULV-specific nucleic acid sequences, respectively, were detected. In conclusion, our investigations demonstrate for the first time natural infections of non-human primates in outdoor enclosures in Germany.

We used high throughput sequencing to determine the complete genome of TIGV, which showed a typical hantavirus organisation. The large (L), medium (M), and small (S) genome segments were found to be 6532, 3594 and 1908 nucleotides long, respectively, and the 5' and 3' termini for all three segments were predicted to form the panhandle-like structure typical for bunyaviruses. Nucleotide-based phylogenetic analyses revealed that all three coding segments cluster in the phylogroup III sensu Guo et al. (2013). However, while TIGV S segment is basal to the Murinae-associated hantaviruses, the M and L segments are basal to the Soricomorpha-associated hantaviruses.

The 771-nucleotide (nt) S segment sequences (coordinates 432 to 1202) of HTN virus strains from Yangju-kun differed by 10 to 40 nt (1.3 to 5.2%) from virus strains from Pocheon-kun, Songnae-ri and Nonsan-kun. Similar degrees of genetic variation were found in the G1 and G2 glycoprotein-encoding M segment. Phylogenetic trees, based on the partial S and M segments and generated by the maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods, demonstrated that virus strains from various geographic regions in South Korea showed a tendency to form two phylogenetic subgroups and were evolutionarily distinct from HTN virus strains from the People's Republic of China.",2000,NA,NA,zover

Antibody-positive samples were tested by RT-PCR, amplified products were sequenced, and phylogenetic trees were constructed for comparison with known hantaviruses. From 104 rodent blood samples collected (40 Bolomys lasiurus, 52 Holochilus sciureus, 12 Oligoryzomys fornesi, and one Proechimys guyannensis), 21 (20.2%) were antibody-positive (one B. lasiurus, five O. fornesi, and 15 H. sciureus). Hantavirus RNA was amplified by PCR from two O. fornesi and four H. sciureus. Viral sequencing identified two hantavirus genotypes. The genotype recovered from O. fornesi, is designated herein as Anajatuba (ANAJ) and the genotype recovered from H. sciureus is designated Rio Mearim (RIME). Phylogenetic analysis of a 643-nucleotide region of the N segment showed both viruses to be most closely related (94-96% nucleotide homology) to RÃ­o MamorÃ© virus, a virus associated with Oligoryzomys microtis in Bolivia and Peru, but not found in northern Brazil.

It is therefore not surprising that several small mammal species have been confirmed to harbour hantaviruses: A. flavicollis (Dobrava virus), A. agrarius (Dobrava virus-Kurkino), M. glareolus (Puumala virus), S. areanus (Seewis virus),M. agrestis, M. arvalis and M. subterraneus (Tula virus). Three of the viruses, namely the Dobrava, Dobrava-Kurkino and Puumala viruses, cause disease in humans, with significant differences in the severity of symptoms. Due to changes in haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome cases (HFRS) epidemiology, a detailed study on phylogenetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of pathogenic and non-pathogenic hantaviruses circulating in ecologically diverse endemic regions was performed. The study presents one of the largest collections of hantavirus L, M and S sequences obtained from hosts and patients within a single country. Several genetic lineages were determined for each hantavirus species, with higher diversity among non-pathogenic compared to pathogenic viruses. For pathogenic hantaviruses, a significant geographic clustering of human- and rodent-derived sequences was confirmed.

The partial M segment and the coding region of nucleocapsid protein (NP) in the S segment of JUN5-14 were PCR-amplified and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the partial M segment (300 bp) revealed that JUN5-14 isolate was closely related to former SEO isolates in Shandong (97.3-99.0% homology) and non-Shandong SEO viruses (84.1-97.7% homology) but distantly related to other hantaviruses (61.5-75.1% homology).

In order to develop a diagnostic assay for hantavirus infection in human, the full-length NP gene of JUN5-14 was expressed in BHK21 cells using the T7 RNA polymerase expression system. The NP expression was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blotting. The expressed NP protein was used as antigen to detect antibody response against NP in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in an IgG-IFA.

Human PUUV and DOBV infections were detected previously in Lithuania, but the presence of Microtus-associated hantaviruses is not known. For this study we screened 234 Microtus voles, including root voles (Microtus oeconomus), field voles (Microtus agrestis) and common voles (Microtus arvalis) from Lithuania for hantavirus infections. This initial screening was based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the S segment and serological analysis. A novel hantavirus was detected in eight of 79 root voles tentatively named ""Rusne virus"" according to the capture location and complete genome sequences were determined. In the coding regions of all three genome segments, Rusne virus showed high sequence similarity to TRAV and TATV and clustered with Kielder hantavirus in phylogenetic analyses of partial S and L segment sequences. Pairwise evolutionary distance analysis confirmed Rusne virus as a strain of the species TRAV/TATV. Moreover, we synthesized the entire nucleocapsid (N) protein of Rusne virus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We observed cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against other hantaviruses, including PUUV, with this new N protein. ELISA investigation of all 234 voles detected Rusne virus-reactive antibodies exclusively in four of 79 root voles, all being also RNA positive, but not in any other vole species. In conclusion, the detection of Rusne virus RNA in multiple root voles at the same trapping site during three years and its absence in sympatric field voles suggests root voles as the reservoir host of this novel virus.

Four inter-lineage reassortment SEOVs carried by Rattus norvegicus and Apodemus agrarius were observed. It suggests that SEOV may cause spillover infections to A. agrarius naturally. The abundance of the phylogenetic lineages of SEOV suggested that central-south China was a radiation center for SEOVs.",2012,2,NA,zover
165,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000142,Secondary contact between diverged host lineages entails ecological speciation in a European hantavirus,"The diversity of viruses probably exceeds biodiversity of eukaryotes, but little is known about the origin and emergence of novel virus species. Experimentation and disease outbreak investigations have allowed the characterization of rapid molecular virus adaptation. However, the processes leading to the establishment of functionally distinct virus taxa in nature remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that incipient speciation in a natural host species has generated distinct ecological niches leading to adaptive isolation in an RNA virus. We found a very strong association between the distributions of two major phylogenetic clades in Tula orthohantavirus (TULV) and the rodent host lineages in a natural hybrid zone of the European common vole (Microtus arvalis). The spatial transition between the virus clades in replicated geographic clines is at least eight times narrower than between the hybridizing host lineages. This suggests a strong barrier for effective virus transmission despite frequent dispersal and gene flow among local host populations, and translates to a complete turnover of the adaptive background of TULV within a few hundred meters in the open, unobstructed landscape. Genetic differences between TULV clades are homogenously distributed in the genomes and mostly synonymous (93.1%), except for a cluster of nonsynonymous changes in the 5' region of the viral envelope glycoprotein gene, potentially involved in host-driven isolation. Evolutionary relationships between TULV clades indicate an emergence of these viruses through rapid differential adaptation to the previously diverged host lineages that resulted in levels of ecological isolation exceeding the progress of speciation in their vertebrate hosts.",2019,2,20,zover

Little is known about the molecular barriers between species that lead to the establishment of this restriction or generally prevent virus emergence in new hosts. Here, we identify genomic polymorphisms in a natural rodent host associated with a strong genetic barrier to the transmission of European Tula orthohantavirus (TULV). We analysed the very abrupt spatial transition between two major phylogenetic clades in TULV across the comparatively much wider natural hybrid zone between evolutionary lineages of their reservoir host, the common vole (Microtus arvalis). Genomic scans of 79,225Â single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 323Â TULV-infected host individuals detected 30 SNPs that were consistently associated with the TULV clades CEN.S or EST.S in two replicate sampling transects. Focusing the analysis on 199 voles with evidence of genomic admixture at the individual level (0.1-0.9) supported statistical significance for all 30Â loci. Host genomic variation at these SNPs explained up to 37.6% of clade-specific TULV infections. Genes in the vicinity of associated SNPs include SAHH, ITCH and two members of the Syngr gene family, which are involved in functions related to immune response or membrane transport. This study demonstrates the relevance of natural hybrid zones as systems not only for studying processes of evolutionary divergence and speciation, but also for the detection of evolving genetic barriers for specialized parasites.",2021,10,21,zover

We described a serosurvey for orthohantaviruses circulation in an apparently healthy human population and small mammals from rural areas in Central Minas Gerais State, Brazil. A total of 240 individuals and 50 small mammals (26 rodents belonging to 10 different species and 24 marsupials from 4 different species) were sampled during 2012-2013. The seroprevalence rates of IgG/IgM antibodies in humans were 7.1 and 1.6%, respectively. Only one rodent, an Oligoryzomys nigripes captured in peridomestic area, tested positive for IgG antibodies and viral RNA.

In this study, we identified the co-circulation of the Araraquara virus and a possible new lineage of the Juquitiba virus (JUQV) in Oligoryzomys nigripes. The implications of co-circulation are still unknown, but it can be the key for increasing viral diversity or emergence of new species through spillover or host switching events leading to co-infection and consequently recombination or reassortment between different virus species. Phylogenetic analyses based on the complete S segment indicated that, alongside with Oligoryzomys mattogrossae rodents, O. nigripes species could also have a whole as JUQV reservoir in the Cerrado biome.

Parts of Lower Saxony in north-western Germany are endemic for PUUV infections. In this study, the complete PUUV genome sequence of a bank vole-derived tissue sample from the 2007 outbreak was determined by a combined primer-walking and RNA ligation strategy. The S, M and L genome segments were 1,828, 3,680 and 6,550 nucleotides in length, respectively. Sliding-window analyses of the nucleotide sequences of all available complete PUUV genomes indicated a non-homogenous distribution of variability with hypervariable regions located at the 3'-ends of the S and M segments. The overall similarity of the coding genome regions to the other PUUV strains ranged between 80.1 and 84.7 % at the level of the nucleotide sequence and between 89.5 and 98.1 % for the deduced amino acid sequences. In comparison to the phylogenetic trees of the complete coding sequences, trees based on partial segments revealed a general drop in phylogenetic support and a lower resolution. The Astrup strain S and M segment sequences showed the highest similarity to sequences of strains from geographically close sites in the OsnabrÃ¼ck Hills region. In conclusion, a primer-walking-mediated strategy resulted in the determination of the first complete nucleotide sequence of a PUUV strain from Central Europe.

The amino acid sequence identities between the G1 and G2 proteins of PH virus and HÃ¤llnÃ¤s virus are respectively 74% and 79%. In contrast, the amino acid sequence similarities between the G1 proteins of PH virus and SR virus or Hantaan virus are only 50%. However the G2 proteins of SR and Hantaan viruses were more closely related to the G2 protein of PH virus with amino acid sequence similarities of approximately 62%. The G1 proteins of all four viruses had three potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites conserved and there was one conserved site in the G2 proteins. Hydrophilicity plots of the four virus glycoproteins were very similar. The region of greatest hydrophilicity was conserved in the HÃ¤llnÃ¤s, SR and Hantaan viruses, and was located near the C terminus of the G1 protein, whereas the region of greatest hydrophilicity in the PH virus glycoprotein precursor is located closer to the N terminus of the G1 protein.

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that French PUUV isolates globally belong to the central European (CE) lineage although isolates from Ardennes are clearly distinct from those in Jura and Orleans, suggesting a different evolutionary history and origin of PUUV introduction in France. Sequence analyses revealed specific amino acid signatures along the N protein, including in PUUV from the Orleans region from where NE in humans has never been reported. The relevance of these mutations in term of pathophysiology is discussed.",2015,10,22,zover

Seven genetic lineages of PUUV have thus far been recorded, which exhibit geographic structure within the distribution of its natural host, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). This study presents evidence for two distinct PUUV lineages co-circulating in Latvia: one previously described from Russia and a novel one that appears to be endemic. The Latvian lineage (LAT) is considerably divergent and several amino acid markers make it easily distinguishable. Phylogenetic analysis suggested a possibility of different evolutionary histories for the PUUV genome segments of LAT.",2011,12,14,zover

We monitored PUUV variants circulating in the host population in Central Finland over a five-year period that included two peak-phases and two population declines. Of 1369 bank voles examined, 360 (26.3%) were found infected with PUUV. Partial sequences of each of the three genome segments were recovered (approx. 12% of PUUV genome) from 356 bank voles. Analyses of these sequences disclosed the following features of PUUV evolution: 1) nucleotide substitutions are mostly silent and deduced amino acid changes are mainly conservative, suggesting stabilizing selection at the protein level; 2) the three genome segments accumulate mutations at a different rate; 3) some of the circulating PUUV variants are frequently observed while others are transient; 4) frequently occurring PUUV variants are composed of the most abundant segment genotypes (copious) and new transient variants are continually generated; 5) reassortment of PUUV genome segments occurs regularly and follows a specific pattern of segments association; 6) prevalence of reassortant variants oscillates with season and is higher in the autumn than in the spring; and 7) reassortants are transient, i.e., they are not competitively superior to their parental variants. Collectively, these observations support a quasi-neutral mode of PUUV microevolution with a steady generation of transient variants, including reassortants, and preservation of a few preferred genotypes.",2013,5,22,zover

The M segment is 3656 nucleotides in length with a predicted region of 3402 bases encoding a precursor glycoprotein of 1134 amino acids subsequently processed into viral glycoproteins 1 and 2 (G1 and G2). A strain comparison between R22 and SR11 (isolated from a rat in Japan), and Hantaan 76-118 (isolated from Apodemus in Korea), and Hallnas B1 (isolated from a bank vole in Sweden) revealed 95%, 74%, and 53% homologies at the deduced amino acid sequence level respectively. This suggests that the rodent host species may be a more important determinant of genetic relationships than geographic proximity. Six potential asparagine linked glycosylation sites (five in G1 and one in G2) were identified, and among them all are conserved in SR11, five in Hantaan virus and four in Hallnas B1 virus. Although different degrees of homology exist among these four viruses at amino acid sequence level, more than 90% of the cysteine residues are conserved, suggesting that structural homology may be very strong between the Hantaviruses. Genetic differences in the M segment genome of R22 and SR11 viruses, within the same serotype viruses, were found as random coding changes; some limited to single amino acids, others in clusters. A recombinant vaccinia virus that contained the fully activated M segment cDNA of R22 was constructed. This recombinant virus expressed two glycoproteins G1 and G2 identical to R22 virus G1 and G2 in molecular weight, cleavage pattern and cellular immunofluorescent patterns.",1991,9,NA,zover

Out of 1,234 serum samples, 124 were found positive for hantavirus-specific IgG and were subsequently serotyped by a focus reduction neutralization test. A total of 112 samples neutralized at least one of the examined hantaviruses-Puumala (PUUV), Saaremaa (SAAV), Dobrava (DOBV), Hantaan, and Seoul viruses-and thereby, the focus reduction neutralization test confirmed the overall hantavirus seroprevalence rate in Estonia to be 9.1%. Most of the sera showed a specific reaction (at least 4-fold higher endpoint titer) of neutralizing antibodies to PUUV (5.1%), while 3.4% showed a SAAV- or SAAV/DOBV-specific reaction. The fact that seven sera (0.6%) could not be serotyped may indicate the presence of an unknown hantavirus serotype. Hantavirus infections were confirmed in 13 of 14 investigated counties, with highly varying seroprevalence rates (1.0-28.4%). The sex ratio was 1.8:1.0 (M:F), and the antibody prevalence peaked in the age group 45-54 years. A total of 513 rodents of seven species trapped in seven counties were examined for the presence of hantavirus antigen, in order to study the distribution of hantavirus natural carriers. Two species, Clethrionomys glareolus and Apodemus agrarius, were found positive for hantaviral antigen in 13.7% and 4.5% of the investigated rodents, respectively. Analyses of viral sequences recovered from infected C. glareolus tissue samples showed that the infecting virus belonged to the PUUV genotype, confirming that PUUV circulates in mainland Estonia. The Estonian PUUV strains were placed in the closest proximity to Russian PUUV strains in phylogenetic trees, suggesting a common evolutionary history. Together with earlier data on SAAV in A. agrarius, the results revealed that two hantaviruses, PUUV and SAAV, are common in Estonia and that the incidence of human infection is high in both cases.",2002,10,10,zover

Previously studies have demonstrated that the mammarenavirus and hantavirus carried by rodents or shrews could cause diseases in human population. To determine the distribution of zoonotic viruses in Shenzhen city, the major city in southern China with a high population density, we analyzed 225 rodents (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus flavipectus) and 196 shrews (Suncus murinus) from urban and rural districts for the presence of mammarenavirus, hantavirus, and hepatitis E virus (HEV) by RT-PCR targeting the conserved regions. The infection rates for mammarenavirus, hantaviruses, and HEV in rodents and shrews were 3.56%, 6.89%, and 1.66%, respectively. Partial genome fragment analysis indicated that mammarenavirus and hantavirus strains had more than 90% and 99% nucleic acid identity with Cardamones virus and Seoul virus, respectively, which cause diseases in humans. Although the present HEV strains identified are typically found worldwide, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a divergence of 16%. To our knowledge, the present work is the first report of the prevalence of mammarenavirus, hantaviruses, and rat HEV strains in rodents and shrews from Shenzhen city, China. Our findings highlight the zoonotic potential of rodent- and shrew-borne mammarenavirus and hantavirus, and the biodiversity of rat HEV isolates in Shenzhen city.

Genetic analyses of 7 S genomes of Reithrodontomys-associated hantaviruses demonstrated that the enzootic of HMV-1 extends from central Mexico into the southwestern United States. A presumed deer mouse hantavirus was found in an R. megalotis animal in Mexico. A highly divergent HMV-1-like virus, tentatively called HMV-2, was identified in a Costa Rican R. mexicanus.

We applied multiplex PCR-based next-generation sequencing to obtain SEOV genome sequences from clinical and reservoir host specimens. Epidemiologic surveillance of R. norvegicus rats in South Korea during 2000-2016 demonstrated that the serologic prevalence of enzootic SEOV infections was not significant on the basis of sex, weight (age), and season.

To investigate the influence of viral evolution and mutations on the seasonality of influenza, we performed a genome-wide analysis of samples collected from 62 influenza A/H3N2-infected patients in Shanghai during 2016-2017. Phylogenetic analysis of all eight segments of the influenza A virus revealed that there were two epidemic influenza virus strains circulating in the 2016-2017 winter season (2016-2017win) and 2017 summer season (2017sum). Replication of the two epidemic viral strains at different temperatures (33, 35, 37, and 39â€‰Â°C) was measured, and the correlation of the mutations in the two epidemic viral strains with temperature sensitivity and viral replication was analyzed. Analysis of the replication kinetics showed that replication of the 2016-2017win strains was significantly restricted at 39â€‰Â°C compared with that of the 2017sum strains. A polymerase activity assay and mutational analysis demonstrated that the PA I668V mutation of the 2016-2017win viruses suppressed polymerase activity in vitro at high temperatures. Taken together, these data suggest that the I668V mutation in the PA subunit of the 2016-2017win strains may confer temperature sensitivity and attenuate viral replication and polymerase activity; meanwhile, the 2017sum strains maintained virulence at high temperatures. These findings highlight the importance of certain mutations in viral adaptation and persistence in subsequent seasons.",2018,10,23,zover

To obtain a better understanding of the genetic characteristic of this emerging 'superbug', the complete genomes of 3 isolates of ST11 carbapenemase-producing hypervirulent K. pneumoniae were generated using the Oxford nanopore MinION platform. Comparative whole-genome analysis identified 13 SNPs and 3 major regions of indels in the chromosomes of the clonally disseminated isolates. ISKpn18-mediated disruption in the mgrB gene, which was associated with colistin resistance, was identified in two later strains, leading to the emergence of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae that was simultaneously colistin- and carbapenem-resistant. Five plasmids were recovered from each isolate, including a 178 Kb IncHI1B/FIB-type rmpA2-bearing virulence plasmid, a 177.5â€‰Kb IncFII/R self-transferable bla KPC-2 -bearing MDR plasmid, a 99.7â€‰Kb Incl1 plasmid and two ColRNAI-type plasmids of sizes of 11.9 and 5.6â€‰Kb, respectively. The presence of homologous regions between the non-conjugative virulence plasmid and conjugative bla KPC-2 -bearing MDR plasmid suggests that transmission of the virulence plasmid from ST23 K. pneumoniae to ST11 CRKP may be mediated by the co-integrated transfer of these two plasmids. Emergence of colistin-resistant and carbapenemase-producing hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strains further emphasizes the urgency for the establishment of a coordinated global program to eradicate hypervirulent and/or pan-drug-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae from clinical settings and the community.",2018,8,12,zover

Most transmission studies in the host were conducted under artificial conditions, or extrapolated information from mark-recapture data. Previous studies using experimentally infected deermice were unable to demonstrate SNV transmission. We explored SNV transmission in outdoor enclosures using naturally infected deermice. Deermice acquiring SNV in enclosures had detectable viral RNA in blood throughout the acute phase of infection and acquired significantly more new wounds (indicating aggressive encounters) than uninfected deermice. Naturally-infected wild deermice had a highly variable antibody response to infection, and levels of viral RNA sustained in blood varied as much as 100-fold, even in individuals infected with identical strains of virus. Deermice that infected other susceptible individuals tended to have a higher viral RNA load than those that did not infect other deermice. Our study is a first step in exploring the transmission ecology of SNV infection in deermice and provides new knowledge about the factors contributing to the increase of the prevalence of a zoonotic pathogen in its reservoir host and to changes in the risk of HPS to human populations.

The S segment is 1830 nucleotides long with an open reading frame coding for 433 amino acids. The identity to the PV HÃ¤llnÃ¤s strain was 83% at the nucleotide and 96% at the amino acid level. The M segment in the Sotkamo strain is 3616 nucleotides long and contains one open reading frame of 1148 amino acids with 83% nucleotide and 94% amino acid identity to the HÃ¤llnÃ¤s strain. Most amino acid changes were conservative and the five predicted glycosylation sites are identical. The amino acid identity to the prototype hantavirus, Hantaan virus, was 62 and 54% for S and M segments, respectively. The coding region of the S segment was further amplified by PCR, ligated to pEX vectors and expressed in Escherichia coli as a beta-galactosidase fusion protein and was seen to be specifically detected by nephropathia epidemica sera in immunoblotting.",1992,4,1,zover
229,10.1016/0042-6822(90)90236-k,Coding properties of the S and the M genome segments of sapporo rat virus: Comparison to other causative agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome,"Three serologically distinct groups of hantaviruses have been associated with severe, moderate, and mild forms of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). To gain a better understanding of the genetic variation among these viruses, we cloned and sequenced the M and the S genome segments of Sapporo rat virus, an etiologic agent of moderate HFRS, and compared the predicted gene products to those of Hantaan virus, and the HÃ¤llnÃ¤s strain of Puumala virus, which are etiologic agents of severe and mild HFRS, respectively. The SR-11 S segment consisted of 1769 nucleotides and had an open reading frame (ORF) in the virus-complementary sense RNA with a coding capacity of 429 amino acids. Deduced amino acids from the SR-11 S segment ORF displayed 83% homology with those of Hantaan nucleocapsid (N) protein. Comparison of the S segment ORFs of all three viruses revealed 58% homology. No evidence for additional nonstructural protein(s) encoded by the SR-11 S segment was obtained. The SR-11 M segment consisted of 3651 nucleotides and had an ORF in the virus-complementary sense RNA with a coding capacity of 1134 amino acids. Amino acid sequences predicted from the SR-11 M segment ORF were 75% homologous with those encoding Hantaan G1 and G2 envelope glycoproteins. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the M segment ORFs of SR-11, Hantaan, and HÃ¤llnÃ¤s viruses revealed a 43% homology for amino acids constituting the G1 proteins and a 55% homology for amino acids constituting the G2 proteins of the three viruses. The envelope proteins of SR-11 virus were localized within the M segment ORF by amino-terminal sequence analysis of purified G1 and G2. G1 initiated at amino acid 17 and G2 at amino acid 647 within the ORF. Five potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites were identified in the SR-11 G1 coding sequences, four of which were conserved between Hantaan and SR-11 viruses and three of which were conserved among all three viruses. One potential glycosylation site was identified in the SR-11 G2 coding sequences and was conserved among Hantaan, SR-11 and HÃ¤llnÃ¤s viruses. Cysteine residues were highly conserved within the M segment ORFs of all three viruses, suggesting a similar structure and function of the G1 and G2 proteins.",1990,5,NA,zover

Alignment and comparison of 1485 nucleotides of the S and M genomic segments enzymatically amplified from these tissues indicated that these deer mice harbored a hantavirus which was genetically similar, differing by less than 2% at the deduced amino-acid level, to the hantavirus implicated in cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occurring in the Four-Corners region of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado in 1993. The peromyscine rodent-borne hantaviruses were, in turn, genetically distinct from other well-characterized hantaviruses, diverging by approximately 30% from Prospect Hill and Puumala viruses at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Phylogenetic analysis using the maximum parsimony, neighbor-joining, and unweighted pair-group methods indicated that the Peromyscus-derived hantavirus shared a common ancestry with arvicolid rodent-borne hantaviruses. Overall congruency of the phylogenetic trees based on the S and M genomic sequences supported the evolutionary position of the peromyscine rodent-borne hantaviruses. Our data also establish the existence of a hantavirus enzootic in deer mice long before the recognition of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the United States.",1994,11,NA,zover

The outbreak affected six students and included two deaths. The epidemiological survey revealed that both of the deceased cases were misdiagnosed initially, and treatment was delayed. Furthermore, a higher rodent population density and lower HFRS vaccine coverage were observed in the affected area, which indicates a possible role in the outbreak. Rattus norvegicus (Rn) and Mus musculus (Mm) were the predominant host populations in the area. Genotyping revealed that all HVs from patients and rodents were Hantaan virus (HTNV). Sequence analysis of the S segments revealed that the HTNVs reported in this study had high similarity with strains reported in 2011 and 1985, but these viruses diverged from a strain isolated in 1984 and the HTNV prototype strain 76-118.

Serum samples were collected from 663 rodents, including Clethrionomys rufocanus, Apodemus speciosus, A. argenteus, and C. rutilus. Antibody to hantavirus was determined by the protein G antibody assay. Positive C. rufocanus were detected in seven of eight collection sites, but no antibody was detected in the remaining rodent species. To reveal the serotype of the circulating virus in C. rufocanus, antibody titers to Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala, and Prospect Hill viruses were compared by means of the focus reduction neutralization test. The titers in positive sera were extremely high to the Sotkamo strain of Puumala virus.

In addition to Europe, TULV was also identified in the Microtus arvalis obscurus voles sampled from Kazakhstan, which shares borders with China. To gain more insight into the molecular epidemiology of TULV, a total of 365 rodents representing 7 species of 4 subfamily (Arvicolinae, Murinae, Gerbillinae, and Cricetinae) were captured in Qapqal county, Xinjiang, northwest China. Hantavirus RNA was recovered from 40 lung tissue samples of M. arvalis obscurus, with the prevalence of 10.96%. Genetic analysis revealed that all recovered viral sequences were most closely related to those of TULV, but exhibited >11% nucleotide differences from all currently known TULV, suggesting that they may represent a new subtype of TULV. In the S tree, the newly identified viruses formed a distinct lineage and showed a close evolutionary relationship with those sampled from Southwestern Siberia and Kazakhstan. However, they exhibited a different clustering pattern in both the M and the L trees, suggesting the possibility of genetic reassortment. Finally, the recombination event was also observed in Xinjiang TULV viruses. In sum, all these data reveal a complex evolutionary history of TULV in Central Asia.",2019,11,NA,zover

In order to detect TULV, we tested Microtus arvalis (MAR) and Microtus subterraneus (MSU) voles captured in two different locations of the Southern Transdanubian region of Hungary. The viral genome was detectable in 37% of the tested MAR voles but, interestingly, was absent in all MSU. Phylogenetic analysis performed with a partial coding sequence of the capsid gene showed that Hungarian TULV strains clustered with viruses detected in western Slovakia and in the Czech Republic.

The deduced sequence of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of Kazakh TULV strains carried specific amino acid signature: T274Q276T281. The Microtus arvalis group includes several sibling species and/or subspecies in Eurasia, indicating recent and ongoing evolutionary radiation.

Therefore in 2014, 49 common voles (Microtus arvalis) from a region in the south of the Netherlands, and in 2015, 241 common voles from regions in the north of the Netherlands were tested with the TULV quantitative RT-PCR. In the southern region, prevalence of TULV was 41% (20/49). In the northern regions, prevalence ranged from 12% (4/34) to 45% (17/38). Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequences showed that the regions fall within different clusters. Voles from the south were also tested on-site for the presence of hantavirus antibodies, but serology results were poorly associated with qRT-PCR results. These findings suggest that TULV may be more widespread than previously thought. No human TULV cases have been reported thus far in the Netherlands, but differentiation between infection by TULV or the closely related Puumala virus is not made in humans in the Netherlands, thus cases may be misdiagnosed.",2017,3,NA,zover

Sequencing of the full-length S segment and the proximal part of the M segment showed that the virus belonged to genotype Tula (TUL) we discovered earlier in Microtus arvalis from Central Russia. This finding supported the concept of host dependence of hantaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggested a similar evolutionary history for S and M genes of TUL strains; thus far there is no evidence for reassortment in TUL. Geographic clustering of TUL genetic variants was observed and different levels of the genetic variability were revealed resembling those estimated for another hantavirus, Puumala (PUU). Comparison of the deduced N protein sequence from Russia and from Moravia showed that genetic drift in TUL occurred not only by accumulation of point mutations but also by the deletion of a nucleotide triplet. It encoded Ser252 which was located within a highly variable hydrophilic part of the N protein carrying B-cell epitopes and presumably forming a loop. Analysis of naturally expressed TUL N-antigen derived from lung tissue of infected voles with MAbs indicated antigenic heterogeneity among TUL strains.",1995,12,NA,zover

In this study we analyzed TULV sequences isolated in Serbia on different occasions and from different rodent hosts: 1987 strain from Microtus subterraneus and 2007 strain from Microtus arvalis. Phylogenetic analysis of both L and S segment sequences is suggestive of geographically related clustering, as previously shown for majority of hantaviruses. Reconstruction of phylogenetic tree for TULV S segment showed that both sequences from Serbia clustered together with sequences from East Slovakia, which had previously been shown to be recombinants (Kosice strain). Exploratory recombination analysis, supported by phylogenetic and amino acid pattern analysis, revealed the presence of recombination in the S segment sequences from Serbia, resulting in mosaic-like structure of TULV S segment similar to the one of Kosice strain. Although recombination is considered a rare event in molecular evolution of negative strand RNA viruses, obtained molecular data in this study support evidence of recombination in TULV, in geographically distant regions of Europe.",2014,1,NA,zover

In this study, hantavirus infections in the rodent population of the KÄ±rklareli-Ä°ÄŸneada Region (north-western Turkey, near the Bulgarian border) were investigated. This region is of particular importance, as it is located in the south-eastern margin of the European continent and was used as an entrance point of Asian faunal elements into Europe. DOBV infection was detected in eight of 73 rodents; all were of the Apodemus flavicollis species. Partial sequences of the viral S-, M-, and L-genome segments were recovered and compared with previously reported DOBV sequences. The newly characterized Turkish strains were similar to other DOBV variants. Silent nucleotide mutations were dominant.

They are transmitted via aerosolized excreta of rodents which also act as reservoir hosts, constituting a unique route for dispersion. Dobrava-Belgrade and Puumala orthohantaviruses have been previously reported from Anatolia, in rodents, case reports and occasional outbreaks. We have collected rodents at several locations during a surveillance study in eastern Anatolia. The specimens were morphologically-identified and various tissues were screened via a generic orthohantavirus reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. DNA barcoding via mitochondrial cytochrome b sequencing was performed in rodents with detectable orthohantavirus sequences. High throughput sequencing was performed for viral genome characterization. Fifty rodents were collected and identified morphologically as Microtus spp. (96%) and Apodemus spp. (4%). Orthohantavirus sequences were detected in lung and spleen or liver tissues of 4 voles (8%), barcoded as Microtus obscurus. The virus sequences were identified as Tula orthohantavirus (TULV) and near-complete genomic segments of the prototype viral genome, tentatively named as the Tula orthohantavirus-Turkey (TULV-T), could be characterized. Putative open reading frames for viral nucleocapsid and a nonstructural protein on the S segment, glycoproteins G1 and G2 on the M segment and viral replicase on the L segment were identified on the TULV-T. Several minor sequence variants were further characterized. No evidence of recombination could be detected and pairwise comparisons displayed over 95% amino acid sequence identities to various Eurasian TULV strains. Phylogenetic analyses revealed distinct clustering of all genome segments from previously-characterized TULV strains via various approaches and models. Here, TULV-T constituted a novel lineage, forming an intermediate among Asian and European TULV lineages.

Total RNA isolated from rodent lung tissues was reverse-transcribed in the presence of a universal 11 nucleotide primer complementary to all three viral RNA segments followed by amplification in a PCR with gene-specific primers. A full-length PCR product of approximately 1800 bp from the S segment encoding the viral nucleoprotein and a product of approximately 900 bp from the M segment (encoding the C-terminal two-thirds of the G2 protein and including the 3' non-coding region) of Puumala virus (from C. glareolus trapped in Udmurtia) were prepared and sequenced. No pronounced differences to Vero cell-grown viruses were seen. The Udmurtia/894Cg/91 strain was more closely related to the Bashkiria/CG18-20/84 strain than to the Finnish prototype strain of Puumala virus, Sotkamo/V-2969/81. Thus there is a correlation with the geographic origin of the three strains. The results indicate the occurrence of genetic drift and different selection pressures leading to (i) clustering of mutations, (ii) a lower frequency of nucleotide substitutions in the coding than in the 3' noncoding regions and (iii) a higher frequency of amino acid substitutions in G2 than in the N protein.",1994,2,1,zover

Epidemiological surveys were carried out to better understand the dynamics of hantavirus infection in humans and animals in Wuhan. During 1961-2011, a total of 21,820 HFRS cases were registered in Wuhan. The two large epidemics had occurred during 1970-1991. They reached peaks in 1973 and 1983, respectively.

In this study, hantaviruses were identified in Apodemus mice, Rattus rats, and Mus mice by indirect immunofluorescent-assay and RT-PCR. Serological and genetic analyses showed that Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV) co-circulated in rodents. Phylogenetic analysis of hantaviral genome sequences revealed a novel genetic lineage of HTNV circulating in rodents in Wuhan. Another lineage of HTNV was closely related to the lineages from the provinces located in the origin and delta of Yangtze River. Remarkably, SEOV variants identified in Wuhan were more closely related to the variants found outside China. Results of the present study showed that HFRS cases in Wuhan are caused by HTNV and SEOV.

Seventeen (6.7%) of 255 rectal swab specimens from rats and six (6.7%) of 90 rectal swab specimens from shrews tested positive for HVs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that rodent and shrew HVs detected in this study were species specific, clustering in the Betaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae clade. Novel Macavirus was detected in Rattus norvegicus (RN/13YX52/24 and RN/14HC50) and gammaherpesviruses in Suncus murinus (SM/14BY7/16/20/97/99/106).These findings have contributed to our understanding of the taxonomy, phylogeny, and biology of HVs.",2016,7,NA,zover

Here we report genome sequences of EastMCMV (from Eastern mice), and set these in the context of MCMV genomes from genus Mus hosts. We show EastMCMV and WestMCMV are genetically distinct. Phylogeny splitting analyses show a genome wide (94%) pattern consistent with no West-East introgression, the major exception (3.8%) being a genome-terminal region of duplicated genes involved in host immune system evasion. As expected from its function, this is a region of maintenance of ancestral polymorphism: The lack of clear splitting signal cannot be interpreted as evidence of introgression. The EastMCMV genome sequences reported here can therefore serve as a well-described resource for exploration of murid MCMV diversity.",2018,8,NA,zover
272,10.1099/vir.0.017327-0,Characterization of a novel wood mouse virus related to murid herpesvirus 4,"Two novel gammaherpesviruses were isolated, one from a field vole (Microtus agrestis) and the other from wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). The genome of the latter, designated wood mouse herpesvirus (WMHV), was completely sequenced. WMHV had the same genome structure and predicted gene content as murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV4; murine gammaherpesvirus 68). Overall nucleotide sequence identity between WMHV and MuHV4 was 85 % and most of the 10 kb region at the left end of the unique region was particularly highly conserved, especially the viral tRNA-like sequences and the coding regions of genes M1 and M4. The partial sequence (71 913 bp) of another gammaherpesvirus, Brest herpesvirus (BRHV), which was isolated ostensibly from a white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula), was also determined. The BRHV sequence was 99.2 % identical to the corresponding portion of the WMHV genome. Thus, WMHV and BRHV appeared to be strains of a new virus species. Biological characterization of WMHV indicated that it grew with similar kinetics to MuHV4 in cell culture. The pathogenesis of WMHV in wood mice was also extremely similar to that of MuHV4, except for the absence of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue at day 14 post-infection and a higher load of latently infected cells at 21 days post-infection.",2009,11,25,zover

We also conducted a systematic virological characterization of a new Wenzhou virus (WENV) isolate, QARn1, from a brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). Full genomic and phylogenetic analyses showed that QARn1 is a previously unidentified strain of Wenzhou mammarenavirus and forms a new branch within the Asian clade. Experimental infection of Sprague-Dawley rats with QARn1 did not present overt pathology, but specific humoral immune responses developed and mild hemorrhage and immunocyte infiltration of the lungs and thymus were observed. These observations have expanded the geographic distribution of WENV to Central Asia, and further confirm that brown rats are natural hosts of Wenzhou virus.",2019,3,NA,zover

We cloned and sequenced the complete genomes of two novel PV types from the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus; RnPV2) and the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus; AsPV1) as well as a novel variant of the recently described MmuPV1 (originally designated as MusPV) from a house mouse (Mus musculus; MmuPV1 variant). In addition, we conducted phylogenetic analyses using a systematically representative set of 79 PV types, including the novel sequences. As inferred from concatenated amino acid sequences of six proteins, MmuPV1 variant and AsPV1 nested within the Beta+Xi-PV super taxon as members of the Pi-PV. RnPV2 is a member of the Iota-PV that has a distant phylogenetic position from Pi-PV. The phylogenetic results support a complex scenario of PV diversification driven by different evolutionary forces including co-divergence with hosts and adaptive radiations to new environments. PV types particularly isolated from mice and rats are the basis for new animal models, which are valuable to study PV induced tumors and new treatment options.",2012,10,15,zover

An earlier report identified a novel papillomavirus of the North American beaver, Castor canadensis (CcanPV1) that was associated with cutaneous exophytic lesions. In the current study, we determined the sequence of the complete 7435 basepair genome of CcanPV1. The genome contains an Upstream Regulatory Region located between the end of L1 and the start of E6, and seven canonical papillomavirus open reading frames encoding five early (E6, E7, E1, E2, and E4) and two late (L2 and L1) proteins. No E5 open reading frame was detected. Phylogenetic analysis of the CcanPV1 genome places the virus between the genera Kappapapillomavirus and Mupapillomavirus.

Papillomavirus genus-specific antigen and viral particles, measuring 55 nm in diameter, were demonstrated in the nuclei of squamous cells of dysplastic lesions showing koilocytotic change. In this study, we cloned a circular genome at a single Kpnl site from one of these dysplastic lesions. The genomic sequence of this clone, consisting of 7647 bp, was shown to be that of a novel papillomavirus with a conserved genomic organization. We named the new virus hamster oral papillomavirus (HOPV). All dysplastic lesions induced by this combination of DMBA application and excisional wounding contained viral DNA. Although Southern blot hybridization analysis could not detect the HOPV genome, PCR analysis demonstrated the latent HOPV genome in the tongue and skin of an untreated hamster. These results suggest that latently present HOPV genome is reactivated by the DMBA/wounding procedures.

Viral DNA could be isolated not only from anogenital wart-like lesions but also from healthy tissues (e.g. liver, kidney, spleen and intestine) without apparent signs of infection. Our finding of a second papillomavirus infecting M. coucha, phylogenetically very distant from the previously known MnPV, reinforces the growing view of warm-blooded vertebrates as being hosts for a number of different papilloma virus types that are not necessarily closely related. The histological descriptions of McPV2-associated anogenital lesions provided here, together with earlier knowledge on MnPV-associated skin carcinogenesis, define M. coucha as an excellent system where the link between infection towards malignancy can be studied in molecular, histochemical and immunological terms in immunocompetent animals. The availability of such an in vivo model also offers the unique opportunity to address defined questions about prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against different papillomavirus infections in their natural host.

The genomic organization is similar to that of other papillomaviruses, with open reading frames E6, E7, E1, E2, and E4 in the early and L2 and L1 in the late region. Due to an unusually large hinge region, the transcriptional activator E2 has a size of 542 amino acids rather than 400 to 460 amino acids, as in other papillomaviruses. An open reading frame E5 coding for a small hydrophobic membrane protein is missing, as is the case for some cutaneous human papillomaviruses (HPV). This fact, together with the composition of cis-responsive elements in its long control region and phylogenetic evaluation of segments of its E6, E1, and L1 genes, indicates a relationship of MnPV to the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus and several HPV types found in lesions of cutaneous epithelia, in particular to those that are associated with epidermodysplasia verruciformis.

In this study, four genomes of Beilong virus from brown rats and black rats were sequenced. Similar to the Beilong virus genome sequenced from kidney mesangial cell line culture, those of J-virus from house mouse and Tailam virus from Sikkim rats, these four genomes from naturally occurring Beilong virus also contain the eight genes (3'-N-P/V/C-M-F-SH-TM-G-L-5'). In these four genomes, the attachment glycoprotein encoded by the G gene consists of 1046 amino acids; but for the original Beilong virus genome sequenced from kidney mesangial cell line, the G CDS was predicted to be prematurely terminated at position 2205 (TGGâ†’TAG), resulting in a 734-amino-acid truncated G protein. This phenomenon of a lack of nonsense mutation in naturally occurring Beilong viruses was confirmed by sequencing this region of 15 additional rodent samples. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the cell line and naturally occurring Beilong viruses were closely clustered, without separation into subgroups. In addition, these viruses were further clustered with J-virus and Tailam virus, with high bootstrap supports of >90%, forming a distinct group in Paramyxoviridae.

In the cistron-overlapping regions in the P gene, one reading frame was conserved, whereas the other overlapping frame was flexible. The priority of one frame could be a strategy for evolution of an overlapping gene of RNA viruses. We found that the carboxyl two thirds of the C protein was conserved over the amino-terminal one third, possessing priority to the overlapping P polypeptide. This suggests that the carboxyl two thirds of the C protein have a functional importance. We also found a highly variable region between the L coding frame and the 5' trailer sequence.

A mutant strain, Ohita-MVC11 (MVC11), was then obtained by passaging M1 in rhesus monkey (LLC-MK2) cells. MVC11 was adapted to LLC-MK2 cells and produced 20 times higher levels of infectious virus than M1. This increased production of infectious virus in LLC-MK2 cells was associated with enhanced viral gene expression.

On the other hand, with an inoculum of only 4 x 10(1) CIU per mouse, corresponding to 1 LD50, M1 replicated well in mouse lung and was highly virulent to mice. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence analyses of the entire genomes of M1 and MVC11 revealed that adaptation to LLC-MK2 cells and the attenuation of mouse pathogenicity of MVC11 were associated with only two amino acid substitutions; one on the C protein (Phe substituted by Ser at position 170) and the other on the RNA polymerase, the L protein (Glu substituted by Ala at position 2050).",1997,12,1,zover

A total of 617 samples comprising fecal, urine, and tissues from 138 rodents and 5 shrews were screened for eight different families of viruses using RT-PCR assays. The results highlight the presence of diverse astroviruses, paramyxoviruses, hepeviruses, and arenavirus, circulating in both wild and synanthropic Kenyan rodents and shrews. Most of the viruses detected in this study are novel strains and some belong to the families that contain important human viral pathogens. Notably, a novel arenavirus was detected in  Grammomys macmillani , a rodent species newly identified to harbor arenavirus, and it potentially represent a novel arenavirus species. Our findings demonstrate the need for continued pathogen surveillance among these small mammals as well as among the vulnerable and exposed livestock and humans.

The virus is pneumotropic in mice and buds at the apical domain of bronchial epithelial cells. On the other hand, the F protein of the protease-activation host range mutant, F1-R, is cleaved by ubiquitous proteases present in different cell lines and in various organs of mice. F1-R causes a systemic infection in mice and the mutant buds bipolarly at the apical and basolateral domains of infected epithelial cells. The enhanced cleavability of the F protein of F1-R has been shown to be a primary determinant for pantropism. Additionally, it has been postulated that bipolar budding of F1-R is required for the systemic spread of the virus and it has been attributed to mutations in the matrix (M) protein of F1-R (Tashiro et al., Virology 184, 227-234, 1991). In this study protease-activation mutants (KD series) were isolated from wild-type virus. They were revealed to bud at the apical domain, and the F protein was cleaved by ubiquitous proteases in mouse organs. The KD mutants were exclusively pneumotropic in mice following intranasal infection, whereas they caused a generalized infection when inoculated directly into the circulatory system. Comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of the F gene of the KD mutants revealed that the deduced amino acid substitutions responsible for enhanced cleavability of the F protein occurred removed from the cleavage site. Mutations were not at all found in the M gene of the KD mutants analyzed, in support of the role of the M protein of F1-R and of a revertant T-9 derived from the latter in bipolar budding. These results suggest that bipolar budding is necessary for the systemic spread of F1-R from the lungs and that apical budding by wild-type virus and the KD mutants leads to respiratory infections. Differential budding at the primary target of infection, in addition to the cleavage-activation of the F protein in mouse organs, is therefore also a determinant for tropism and pathogenicity of Sendai virus in mice.",1992,4,NA,zover
301,10.1016/j.meegid.2016.11.014,Identification and genomic characterization of a novel rat bocavirus from brown rats in China,"Despite recent discoveries of novel animal bocaparvoviruses, current understandings on the diversity and evolution of bocaparvoviruses are still limited. We report the identification and genome characterization of a novel bocaparvovirus, rat bocaparvovirus (RBoV), in brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) in China. RBoV was detected in 11.5%, 2.4%, 16.2% and 0.3% of alimentary, respiratory, spleen and kidney samples respectively, of 636 brown rats by PCR, but not in samples of other rodent species, suggesting that brown rats are the primary reservoir of RBoV. Six RBoV genomes sequenced from three brown rats revealed the presence of three ORFs, characteristic of bocaparvoviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that RBoV was distantly related to other bocaparvoviruses, forming a distinct cluster within the genus, with â‰¤55.5% nucleotide identities to the genome of ungulate bocaparvovirus 3, supporting its classification as a novel bocaparvovirus species. RBoV possessed a putative second exon encoding the C-terminal region of NS1 and conserved RNA splicing signals, similar to human bocaparvoviruses and canine bocaparvovirus. In contrast to human, feline and canine bocaparvoviruses which demonstrates inter/intra-host viral diversity, partial VP1/VP2 sequences of 49 RBoV strains demonstrated little inter-host genetic diversity, suggesting a single genetic group. Although the pathogenicity of RBoV remains to be determined, its presence in different host tissues suggests wide tissue tropism. RBoV represents the first bocaparvovirus in rodents with genome sequenced, which extends our knowledge on the host range of bocaparvoviruses. Further studies are required to better understand the epidemiology, genetic diversity and pathogenicity of bocaparvoviruses in different rodent populations.",2017,1,NA,zover

It was subsequently detected from several animal species including shrews, bats, and nonhuman primates. In this study, we identified a novel Protoparvovirus, designated RatBuV, from the intestinal contents of wild rats using viral metagenomics. The near complete genome was 4643 nt encoding NS1, VP1, and VP2 proteins. Phylogenetic analysis over the complete genome showed that RatBuV clustered with Mpulungu BuV from shrews. Sequence analysis indicated that the putative protein sequences of NS1, VP1, and VP2 of RatBuV shared identities of 50.6-77.2, 48.3-77.3, and 47.1-78.3 %, respectively, with those of human BuVs, MpBuV, and WUHARV parvovirus, suggesting RatBuV belongs to a new species of Protoparvovirus.

Here, using viral metagenomics method, we identified a novel Chapparvovirus from feces of wild rats and designated it as rat parvovirus 2 (RPV2). The nearly complete genome of RPV2 is 4222-nt long and includes two ORFs encoding a 654-aa nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and a 472-aa capsid protein (VP), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis over the amino acid sequence of the NS1 showed that RPV2 clustered with Eidolon helvum parvovirus 2 (EHPV2), porcine parvovirus 7 (PPV7), and turkey parvovirus 1 (TP1), forming a separate clade. Sequence analysis indicated that the NS1 protein of RPV2 shared the highest amino acid sequence identity (51Â %) with that of EHPV2.

304,10.1016/j.virol.2006.05.023,Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid genes isolated from rat and mouse liver genomic DNA define two new AAV species distantly related to AAV-5,"Using polymerase chain reactions and genome walking strategies, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-like capsid genes were isolated from rat and mouse liver genomic DNA, where they are present at <5 copies per cell. These genes define two new species of AAVs since their amino acid sequences are <60% identical to each other or to any other AAV capsid. They are most similar to the AAV-5 and goat AAV capsids. A recombinant vector with the mouse AAV capsid and a lacZ transgene (rAAV-mo.1 lacZ) was able to transduce rodent cell lines in vitro. However, it was not able to transduce eight human cell lines or primary human fibroblasts in vitro. It did not bind heparin and its ability to transduce cells in vitro was not inhibited by heparin, mucin, or sialic acid suggesting it uses a novel entry receptor. rAAV-mo.1 lacZ was 29 times more resistant to in vitro neutralization by pooled, purified human IgG than AAV-2. In vivo, rAAV-mo.1 lacZ efficiently transduced murine ocular cells after a subretinal injection. Intramuscular injection of a rAAV-mo.1 human factor IX (hFIX) vector into mice resulted in no detectable hFIX in plasma, but intravenous injection resulted in high plasma levels of hFIX, equivalent to that obtained from a rAAV-8 hFIX vector. Biodistribution analysis showed that rAAV-mo.1 primarily transduced liver after an intravenous injection. These AAV capsids may be useful for gene transfer in rodents.",2006,9,NA,zover

We found that it is unique from the profiles of human parvovirus B19 and simian parvovirus, the members in the genus Erythrovirus so far characterized, in that the small RNA transcripts were not processed for encoding small non-structural proteins. However, like the large non-structural protein NS1 of the human parvovirus B19, the ChpPV NS1 is a potent inducer of apoptosis. Further phylogenetic analysis of ChpPV with other parvoviruses in the subfamily Parvovirinae indicates that ChpPV is distinct from the members in genus Erythrovirus. Thus, we conclude that ChpPV may represent a new genus in the family Parvoviridae.",2010,12,3,zover
306,10.1006/viro.1998.9518,A Novel Parvovirus Isolated from Manchurian Chipmunks,"A novel parvovirus was identified in Manchurian chipmunks inhabiting Korea. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in sera from 4 animals among 62 apparently healthy chipmunks. Electron microscopic examination of the HBsAg-positive sera revealed virus-like spherical particles 20-22 nm in diameter. Extraction of nucleic acid under annealing conditions from the serum samples containing virus-like particles yielded a single species of DNA molecule with the electrophoretic mobility of 5.6-kb double-stranded DNA. Four overlapping clones that encompassed almost the full-length viral genome, except both ends, were obtained. By sequencing these clones, we determined the sequence of 5097 nucleotides of the viral DNA. Two open reading frames were identified, with the left side open reading frame encoding a putative nonstructural protein and the right side open reading frame encoding a putative capsid protein. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed significant homology to parvovirus B19 and simian parvovirus, but showed little homology to other mammalian autonomous parvoviruses or adeno-associated viruses. These observations indicate that the virus isolated from Manchurian chipmunks is a novel parvovirus and may be a potentially useful animal model of human B19 infection as a new member of the Erythrovirus genus of the Parvoviridae.",1999,1,NA,zover

Vietnam is the largest swine producer in South East Asia. Systematic virological and serological surveillance of swine influenza viruses was carried out in Northern Vietnam from May 2013 to June 2014 with monthly sampling of pigs in local and large collective slaughterhouses and in a live pig market. Influenza A seroprevalence in the local slaughterhouses and in the large collective slaughterhouse was 48.7% and 29.1%, respectively. Seventy-seven influenza A viruses were isolated, all from the large collective slaughterhouse. Genetic analysis revealed six virus genotypes including H1N1 2009 pandemic (H1N1pdm09) viruses, H1N2 with H1 of human origin, H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 reassortants, and triple-reassortant H3N2 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of swine and human H1N1pdm09 viruses showed evidence of repeated spill-over from humans to swine rather than the establishment of H1N1pdm09 as long-term distinct lineage in swine.

309,10.1099/0022-1317-77-5-899,Molecular characterization of newly recognized rodent parvoviruses,"Several autonomous rodent parvoviruses distinct from the prototypic rodent parvoviruses have been isolated. These include variants of a mouse parvovirus (MPV), a hamster isolate designated hamster parvovirus (HaPV), and a variant strain of minute virus of mice (MVM) designated MVM-Cutter or MVM(c). In this study, the DNA sequence of the coding regions of the viral genome and the predicted protein sequences for each of these new isolates were determined and compared to the immunosuppressive and prototypic strains of MVM [MVM(i) and MVM(p)], the rodent parvovirus H-1, and LuIII, an autonomous parvovirus of uncertain host origin. Sequence comparisons showed that the MPV isolates were almost identical, HaPV was very similar to MPV, and MVM(c) was most similar to MVM(i) and MVM(p). Haemagglutination inhibition assays revealed that MPV and HaPV represent two serotypes distinct from previously characterized rodent parvovirus serotypes while MVM(c) belongs to the MVM serotype. Each of the newly isolated rodent parvoviruses was shown to encapsidate a predominantly negative-sense 5 kb DNA genome and to encode two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2) and two structural viral proteins (VP1 and VP2). These studies indicate that MPV and HaPV are autonomous parvoviruses distinct from previously characterized parvoviruses and MVM(c) is a variant strain of MVM distinct from MVM(i) and MVM(p).",1996,5,1,zover

Here, two highly divergent BOVs (tentatively named as Himalayan marmot BOV, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2) were identified in the livers and feces of wild Himalayan marmots in China, by viral metagenomic analysis. Five of 300 liver samples from Himalayan marmots were positive for HMBOV1 and five of 99 fecal samples from these animals for HMBOV2. Their nearly complete genome sequences are 4,672 and 4,887 nucleotides long, respectively, with a standard genomic organization and containing protein-coding motifs typical for BOVs. Based on their NS1, NP1, and VP1, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are most closely related to porcine BOV SX/1-2 (approximately 77.0%/50.0%, 50.0%/53.0%, and 79.0%/54.0% amino acid identity, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis of these three proteins showed that HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 formed two distinctly independent branches in BOVs. According to these results, HMBOV1 and HMBOV2 are two different novel species in the Bocaparvovirus genus. Their identification expands our knowledge of the genetic diversity and evolution of BOVs.

A full-length, infectious clone of LuIII was constructed and the complete nucleotide sequence of the genome was determined. Comparison of the LuIII sequence with those of MVMp and H-1 revealed that these viruses are virtually identical with respect to the genomic organization, location of regulatory signals, mRNA splicing patterns, and amino acid sequences of viral proteins. However, two regions of the LuIII sequence differ significantly from those of the rodent parvoviruses. At mu 92, LuIII has only one copy of a sequence found as a direct repeat in MVMp and H-1. Upstream of this sequence, at mu 89, there is an A-T-rich region, 47 nucleotides in length, unique to the LuIII genome.

MPVs cause more distinctive deleterious effects in immune-compromised or genetically-engineered mice than immuno-competent mice. At the University of Louisville (U of L), there was an unexpected increase of MPV sero-positivity for MPV infections in mouse colonies between January 2006 and February 2007, resulting in strategic husbandry changes aimed at controlling MPV spread throughout the animal facility. To investigate these MPVs, VP2 genes of seven MPVs were cloned and sequenced from eight documented incidences by PCR technology. The mutations in these VP2 genes were compared to those found at the Genbank database (NCBI; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and an intra-institutional phylogenetic tree for MPV infections at U of L was constructed. We discovered that the seven MPV isolates were different from those in Genbank and were not identical to each other. These MPVs were designated MPV-UL1 to 7; none of them were minute virus of mice (MVMs). Four isolates could be classified as MPV1, one was classified as MPV2, and two were defined as novel types with less than 96% and 94% homology with existing MPV types. Considering that all seven isolates had mutations in their VP2 genes and no mutations were observed in VP2 genes of MPV during a four-month time period of incubation, we concluded that all seven MPVs isolated at U of L between 2006 and 2007 probably originated from different sources.

ELISA tests using recombinant major capsid protein (rVP2) and recombinant major non-structural protein (rNS1) as antigens were developed and their performance in serologic detection of rodent parvovirus infection was assessed. MPV-rVP2 and MMV-rVP2 ELISAs reacted specifically with anti-MPV and anti-MMV mouse sera, respectively. MMV-rNS1 antigen had a wide reaction range with antisera to rodent parvoviruses including MPV, MMV, Kilham rat virus (KRV) and H-1 virus. All mice oronasally infected with MPV were seropositive at 4 weeks post-infection in screening by ELISAs using MPV-rVP2 and MMV-rNS1 antigens, but were negative by conventional ELISA using whole MMV antigen. A contact transmission experiment revealed that transmission of MPV occurred up to 4 weeks post-infection, and all cage mates were seropositive in screening with MPV-rVP2 and MMV-rNS1 ELISAs. These results indicate that MPV-rVP2 and MMV-rVP2 are specific ELISA antigens which distinguish between MPV and MVM infection, while MMV-rNS1 antigen can be used in generic ELISA for a variety of rodent parvoviruses. The higher sensitivity of MPV-rVP2 ELISA than conventional ELISA for detecting seroconversion to MPV in oronasally infected mice as well as in cage mates suggests the usefulness of MPV-rVP2 ELISA in quarantine and microbiological monitoring of MPV infection in laboratory mice.",2006,NA,NA,zover

The high detection rates of PBV in free roaming rats on St. Kitts emphasizes the importance of further studies on epidemiology and genetic makeup of PBVs in Rattus spp.",2018,11,NA,zover
332,10.1016/j.virusres.2009.03.006,Molecular characterization of picobirnaviruses from new hosts,"Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) have recently been classified into the Picobirnaviridae family. They are small, non-enveloped viruses with bisegmented, double-stranded (ds) RNA genomes. Although they are found in the feces of a broad range of hosts, information regarding their genomes is limited to viruses detected from humans, rabbits, and porcine. Identification of PBVs has been done using PAGE and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). In this study, we present a phylogenetic analysis of PBVs detected in the feces of dogs, snakes, and rats. In addition, we compare these strains to those from human and porcine hosts. To do so, 487 fecal specimens from dogs, snakes and rats were analyzed by PAGE. The positive specimens for PBV were tested by RT-PCR using primers for genogroup I of the PBVs. From the 11 genogroup I PBV samples, at least one from each host was sequenced and submitted for phylogenetic analysis. All of the sequences showed high homology with the human and porcine genogroup I PBV sequences. In this study we report the first detection of PBVs in snakes (8.5%). We also report a phylogenetic analysis that goes beyond humans and pigs to include dogs, rats, and snakes. However, more hosts must be included in the analysis so that we may reach better conclusions regarding the spread of these viruses.",2009,7,NA,zover

This strain is characterised by its ability to present convulsive crises of audiogenic origin. Almost 16 % (90 males and 60 females) of the 975 animals were affected during a 5-year period by the development of a progressing lymphoid tumour and exhibited similar clinical profiles characterised by lethargy, anorexia, evident abdominal distension, and a rapid disease progression resulting in mortality within 1 to 2 weeks. A TaqManÂ® probe-based real-time PCR analysis of genomic DNA from different tissue samples of the affected animals revealed the presence of a DNA sequence encoding the hamster polyomavirus (HaPyV) VP1 capsid protein. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis using HaPyV-VP1-specific monoclonal antibodies confirmed the presence of viral proteins in all hamster tumour tissues analysed within the colony. An indirect ELISA and western blot analysis confirmed the presence of antibodies against the VP1 capsid protein in sera, not only from affected and non-affected GASH:Sal hamsters but also from control hamsters from the same breeding area. The HaPyV genome that accumulated in tumour tissues typically contained deletions affecting the noncoding regulatory region and adjacent sequences coding for the N-terminal part of the capsid protein VP2.",2013,5,30,zover
337,10.1023/a:1008017201999,NA,"On the basis of its genome organization the hamster polyomavirus (HaPV) is closely related to the murine polyomavirus Py. But HaPV infection, in contrast to Py infection, gives rise to two different tumor types; depending on the hamster strain used for infection, HaPV induces either epitheliomas or lymphomas. Although the HaPV virions were shown to be similar to those of Py and SV40, more precise information about the structure and protein composition of the HaPV capsid was still missing. Here we describe the primary structure of the capsid protein-encoding HaPV genes and the structure and protein composition of the HaPV capsid. Virions isolated from epitheliomas in HaPV-infected hamsters were shown by electron microscopy to be spherical particles with the typical icosahedral structure of polyomaviruses. However, in contrast to the capsids of SV40 and Py, a T = 7 laevo symmetry of HaPV capsids was observed. Separation of HaPV virions in SDS polyacrylamide gels and Western blotting with VP1-specific antisera identified VP1 as the major capsid protein species corresponding in its molecular weight to the predicted value of 41.8 kDa. Because of the presence of two potential translational initiation sites in the VP1 gene, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of virion VP1 was determined and found to start at the second initiation site. The amino acid homologies of HaPV capsid proteins shared with Py varied between 65.5% (VP1), 45.4% (VP3) and 44.6% (VP2), whereas the homologies to the relevant proteins of other polyomaviruses were found to range between 49.6-57.9% for VP1 and 28.9-41% for VP2/VP3.",1999,NA,NA,zover

Skin biopsies from 20 hamsters from five different colonies were affected, and two of the affected hamsters also had lymphoma. Two owners reported that 16 of 70 hamsters and 50 of 100 hamsters in their colonies had similar skin lesions. These tumours have previously been associated in laboratory colonies with hamster polyomavirus (HaPV) infection. Examination of skin tissues by electron microscopy failed to reveal intranuclear virus particles. Using recombinant major capsid protein VP1 of HaPV, VP1-specific antibodies were detected in sera from 12 of 12 affected hamsters and in four of four unaffected in-contact hamsters, by ELISA. The ELISA data were verified by immunoblot analysis. Eleven of 13 serum samples contained antibodies which reacted with at least one recombinant structural HaPV protein (VP2), including samples from three in-contact unaffected hamsters. Nine of the 11 anti-VP2-positive samples also reacted with recombinant VP3 of HaPV, and six reacted with VP1. Amplification by PCR and sequencing detected VP1 -encoding sequences showing a high degree of homology with HaPV. The findings suggest a possible infection by HaPV or a HaPV-like virus and it is likely that such an infection was enzootic within the affected colonies.",2002,7,6,zover

On gross examination, the hamster had multiple abdominal adhesions and enlargement of the mesenteric lymph node. Histologic evaluation revealed multicentric lymphoma of the liver, jejunum, mesenteric lymph node, testicular fat pad, and epididymis. Based on the hamster's age and the type and distribution of the lymphoma, a presumptive diagnosis of hamster polyomavirus-induced lymphoma was made. A specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed, which confirmed the diagnosis. An in situ PCR demonstrated hamster polyomavirus DNA within lymphocytes of the multicentric lymphoma and renal tubular epithelial cells and within clusters of enterocytes in the jejunum.

However, in contrast to other polyomaviruses, KV exhibits a stringent host and cell specificity. To determine the relationship of these viruses, the complete DNA sequence of KV consisting of 4754 bp was determined. The predicted organization of K virus was found to be comparable to that of other members of the polyomavirus family with two strands coding in an opposite direction of an intergenic region harboring putative control elements for gene expression. These include consensus elements for the origin of DNA replication as well as predicted promoter protein binding domains. Inferred signal sequences for 3' and 5' end formation of mRNAs and splice/branch site consensus sequences resemble those found among the SV40 group of viruses. From the organization of the genome two nonstructural proteins, large T and small t antigen, are predicted, both of which share the same amino-terminal sequence. Three putative capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 are encoded by alternative open reading frames. The nucleotide sequence in the proposed origin of DNA replication and the inferred amino acid sequence of the viral proteins suggest an evolutionary relationship placing KV between the murine PyV and the SV40 group of viruses. In the region bearing putative transcriptional control elements less nucleotide similarity to that of other polyomaviruses is found and this may reflect the unique host and cell specificity of KV.",1991,4,NA,zover

All cloned and sequenced genomes had the typical PyV genome organization, including putative open reading frames for early regulatory proteins large T antigen and small T antigen on one strand and for structural late proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) on the other strand. Virus-like particles (VLPs) were generated by yeast expression of the VP1 protein of both PyVs. VLP-based ELISA and large T-antigen sequence-targeted polymerase-chain reaction investigations demonstrated signs of infection of these novel PyVs in about 42% of bank voles and 18% of common voles. In most cases only viral DNA, but not VP1-specific antibodies were detected. In additional animals exclusively VP1-specific antibodies, but no viral DNA was detected, indicative for virus clearance. Phylogenetic and clustering analysis including all known PyV genomes placed novel bank vole and common vole PyVs amongst members of the tentative Wukipolymavirus genus. The other known four rodent PyVs, Murine PyV and Hamster PyV, and Murine pneumotropic virus and Mastomys PyV belong to different phylogenetic clades, tentatively named Orthopolyomavirus I and Orthopolyomavirus II, respectively. In conclusion, the finding of novel vole-borne PyVs may suggest an evolutionary origin of ancient wukipolyomaviruses in rodents and may offer the possibility to develop a vole-based animal model for human wukipolyomaviruses.",2015,10,16,zover

In this work, seven Brazilian Vaccinia virus strains and the Lister-derived Brazilian vaccine strain, named Lister-Butantan, were compared based on the sequences of ten host range and virulence related genes. Comparison of Brazilian Vaccinia virus strains with Lister-Butantan revealed several differences. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the existence of genetically distinct Brazilian Vaccinia virus groups and has not thus far demonstrated a close relationship between Brazilian strains and Lister-Butantan. In this study, the BeAn58058 and SPAn232 strains were grouped together with the Belo Horizonte and Guarani P1 strains. Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in host range and virulence genes as well as differences in the deduced amino acid sequences were detected among Brazilian Vaccinia virus. This genetic diversity may result in a plethora of different biological properties presented by Brazilian Vaccinia virus, including differences in adaptation to the host as well as pathogenic properties.

346,10.1089/vbz.2010.0170,Orthopox Virus Infections in Eurasian Wild Rodents,"The genus Orthopoxvirus includes variola (smallpox) virus and zoonotic cowpox virus (CPXV). All orthopoxviruses (OPV) are serologically cross-reactive and cross-protective, and after the cessation of smallpox vaccination, CPXV and other OPV infections represent an emerging threat to human health. In this respect CPXV, with its reservoir in asymptomatically infected wild rodents, is of special importance. In Europe, clinical cowpox has been diagnosed in both humans and animals. The main objective of this study was to elucidate the prevalence of OPV infections in wild rodents in different parts of Eurasia and to compare the performance of three real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods in detecting OPV DNA in wildlife samples. We investigated 962 wild rodents from Northern Europe (Finland), Central Europe (Germany), and Northern Asia (Siberia, Russia) for the presence of OPV antibodies. According to a CPXV antigen-based immunofluorescence assay, animals from 13 of the 17 locations (76%) showed antibodies. Mean seroprevalence was 33% in Finland (variation between locations 0%-69%), 32% in Germany (0%-43%), and 3.2% (0%-15%) in Siberia. We further screened tissue samples from 513 of the rodents for OPV DNA using up to three real-time PCRs. Three rodents from two German and one Finnish location were OPV DNA positive. The amplicons were 96% to 100% identical to available CPXV sequences. Further, we demonstrated OPV infections as far east as the Baikal region and occurring in hamster and two other rodent species, ones previously unnoticed as possible reservoir hosts. Based on serological and PCR findings, Eurasian wild rodents are frequently but nonpersistently infected with OPVs. Results from three real-time PCR methods were highly concordant. This study extends the geographic range and wildlife species diversity in which OPV (or CPXV) viruses are naturally circulating.",2011,8,NA,zover

In order to successfully replicate within a host cell, poxviruses have evolved a number of strategies to counteract the pleiotropic effects of interferon-gamma. In particular, the leporipoxvirus myxoma virus was shown to express an extracellular soluble interferon-gamma receptor homolog, denoted M-T7, which is capable of inhibiting the anti-viral activities of rabbit interferon-gamma (C. Upton, K. Mossman, and G. McFadden, 1992, Science 258, 1369-1372). Here, we demonstrate that expression of soluble interferon-gamma receptor homologs appears to be characteristic of all poxviruses tested, including Shope fibroma virus, vaccinia virus (strains WR and IHDW), ectromelia virus, cowpox virus, and rabbitpox virus. We have cloned, sequenced, and characterized the interferon-gamma binding protein in supernatants from ectromelia virus-infected cells, and demonstrate the capability of this soluble protein to bind human, murine, and rabbit interferon-gamma with similar affinity. We also investigate the properties of the vaccinia virus interferon-gamma binding protein and demonstrate that this protein binds human and rabbit interferon-gamma with similar affinity and binds murine interferon-gamma with a significantly lower relative affinity.

Comparisons of the VP7 amino acid sequences of the five murine rotavirus strains with rotavirus strains representative of G serotypes 1-14 showed that the murine strains were highly homologous to one another and more closely related to strains representing G3 than to any other G type. Analysis of the VP4 amino acid sequences of the murine strains revealed the presence of at least two murine P types. Therefore, sequence analysis would predict that the murine rotaviruses are G3 or G3-like and represent at least two unique P types (tentatively P17 for EW, EB, EC, and EL and P18 for EHP). When we attempted to categorize the murine strains by serum neutralization tests, our results were less clear. Serum to two murine strains, EHP and EW, displayed one-way reactivity by focus-reduction neutralization assays using several prototype G3 strains. The G3 serotyping monoclonal antibody 159 failed to neutralize EHP and EW, while the G3-specific monoclonal YO-1E2 neutralized EHP, but not EW. A reassortant (A15) containing VP7 from EW and VP4 from RRV was neutralized by these two G3-specific monoclonal antibodies to a level 8- to 20-fold more than EW, but was still 64- to 250-fold less than either SA11 and RRV.

Low and inconsistent levels of EDIM shedding in some strains of adult mice, particularly those on C57BL/6 backgrounds, established the need for an alternative murine rotavirus strain for these studies. Fortuitously, such a rotavirus strain was obtained from mice housed within the conventional colony at Children's Hospital. This strain, named EMcN, was clearly distinguishable from EDIM based on electropherotype. Furthermore, sequence analyses of VP4 and VP7 genes of EMcN revealed non-identities in 5% of the amino acids of both proteins relative to EDIM but established EMcN as another G3P[16] strain of murine rotavirus. Subgroup analysis showed EMcN belonged to SG1 while EDIM was found to be non-SG1/SG2. Similarly, unlike EDIM, the EMcN strain was identified as serotype G3 based on neutralization by hyperimmune antisera developed against prototype human and simian G3 rotavirus strains. Although EDIM produced more days of diarrhea and was shed in greater quantities in neonatal BALB/c mice, EMcN was shed in much greater quantities in adult BALB/c mice. More importantly, in contrast to the EDIM strain, EMcN was shown to be consistently shed in large quantities in adult C57BL/6 mice and ko mice on this background.

It has previously been suggested that infection of their respective hosts may have occurred as a result of a species jump from another, as yet unidentified vertebrate host. To investigate possible sources of these retroviruses in the Australian context, DNA samples were obtained from 42 vertebrate species and screened using PCR in order to detect proviral sequences closely related to KoRV and GALV. Four proviral partial sequences totalling 2880 bases which share a strong similarity with KoRV and GALV were detected in DNA from a native Australian rodent, the grassland melomys, Melomys burtoni. We have designated this novel gammaretrovirus Melomys burtoni retrovirus (MbRV). The concatenated nucleotide sequence of MbRV shares 93% identity with the corresponding sequence from GALV-SEATO and 83% identity with KoRV. The geographic ranges of the grassland melomys and of the koala partially overlap. Thus a species jump by MbRV from melomys to koalas is conceivable. However the genus Melomys does not occur in mainland South East Asia and so it appears most likely that another as yet unidentified host was the source of GALV.",2014,9,24,zover

However, the viral elements related to their pathogenicity have yet to be identified at the nucleotide or amino acid level. Here, through 30 passages in mouse neuroblastoma NA cells, we have established an attenuated variant of street rabies virus strain 1088, originating from a rabid woodchuck followed by 2 passages in the brains of suckling mice. The variant, 1088-N30, was well adapted to NA cells and highly attenuated in adult mice after intramuscular (i.m.) but not intracerebral (i.c.) inoculations. 1088-N30 had seven nucleotide substitutions, and the R196S mutation of the G protein led to an additional N-glycosylation. Street viruses usually possess one or two N-glycosylation sites on the G protein, 1088 has two, while an additional N-glycosylation site is observed in laboratory-adapted strains. We also established a cloned variant 1088-N4#14 by limiting dilution. Apart from the R196S mutation, 1088-N4#14 possessed only one amino acid substitution in the P protein, which is found in several field isolates. 1088-N4#14 also efficiently replicated in NA cells and was attenuated in adult mice after i.m. inoculations, although it was more pathogenic than 1088-N30. The spread of 1088-N30 in the brain was highly restricted after i.m. inoculations, although the pattern of 1088-N4#14's spread was intermediate between that of the parental 1088 and 1088-N30. Meanwhile, both variants strongly induced humoral immune responses in mice compared to 1088. Our results indicate that the additional N-glycosylation is likely related to the reduced pathogenicity. Taken together, we propose that the number of N-glycosylation sites in the G protein is one of the determinants of the pathogenicity of street rabies viruses.",2012,4,NA,zover
367,10.1016/j.virusres.2004.12.003,Mongoose rabies in southern Africa: a re-evaluation based on molecular epidemiology,"Relative to the developed world, rabies has been poorly studied in the vast African continent. The southern African countries of Zimbabwe and South Africa, however, are known to sustain a great diversity of lyssaviruses, with large biological variations amongst genotype 1 (rabies viruses) at present more apparent here than elsewhere on the continent. One recognized biotype of rabies virus in the subcontinent appears to be specifically adapted to a variety of mongooses, belonging to the Viverrinae subfamily (family Herpestidae) and are commonly referred to as viverrid viruses, although the term mongoose rabies would be more correct, considering the taxonomic status of the host species involved. It was our objective to study the genetic relationships of 77 rabies virus isolates of this mongoose biotype, isolated in South Africa and Zimbabwe, towards elucidation of the molecular epidemiology of this interesting group of African viruses. In our study of a 592 nucleotide sequence encompassing the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein and the G-L intergenic region of the viral genomes, we provide the first comprehensive data on the molecular epidemiology of these viruses and indicate a history of extended evolutionary adaptation in this geographical domain. The molecular epidemiological observations reported here are highly unlikely to be limited to the small geographical areas of South Africa and Zimbabwe and illustrate the need for lyssavirus surveillance in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa and throughout the entire continent.",2005,5,NA,zover
368,10.1371/journal.ppat.1004664,Evolution of Genome Size and Complexity in the Rhabdoviridae,"RNA viruses exhibit substantial structural, ecological and genomic diversity. However, genome size in RNA viruses is likely limited by a high mutation rate, resulting in the evolution of various mechanisms to increase complexity while minimising genome expansion. Here we conduct a large-scale analysis of the genome sequences of 99 animal rhabdoviruses, including 45 genomes which we determined de novo, to identify patterns of genome expansion and the evolution of genome complexity. All but seven of the rhabdoviruses clustered into 17 well-supported monophyletic groups, of which eight corresponded to established genera, seven were assigned as new genera, and two were taxonomically ambiguous. We show that the acquisition and loss of new genes appears to have been a central theme of rhabdovirus evolution, and has been associated with the appearance of alternative, overlapping and consecutive ORFs within the major structural protein genes, and the insertion and loss of additional ORFs in each gene junction in a clade-specific manner. Changes in the lengths of gene junctions accounted for as much as 48.5% of the variation in genome size from the smallest to the largest genome, and the frequency with which new ORFs were observed increased in the 3' to 5' direction along the genome. We also identify several new families of accessory genes encoded in these regions, and show that non-canonical expression strategies involving TURBS-like termination-reinitiation, ribosomal frame-shifts and leaky ribosomal scanning appear to be common. We conclude that rhabdoviruses have an unusual capacity for genomic plasticity that may be linked to their discontinuous transcription strategy from the negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome, and propose a model that accounts for the regular occurrence of genome expansion and contraction throughout the evolution of the Rhabdoviridae.",2015,2,13,zover
369,10.1371/journal.pone.0002057,Genomic Diversity and Evolution of the Lyssaviruses,"Lyssaviruses are RNA viruses with single-strand, negative-sense genomes responsible for rabies-like diseases in mammals. To date, genomic and evolutionary studies have most often utilized partial genome sequences, particularly of the nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes, with little consideration of genome-scale evolution. Herein, we report the first genomic and evolutionary analysis using complete genome sequences of all recognised lyssavirus genotypes, including 14 new complete genomes of field isolates from 6 genotypes and one genotype that is completely sequenced for the first time. In doing so we significantly increase the extent of genome sequence data available for these important viruses. Our analysis of these genome sequence data reveals that all lyssaviruses have the same genomic organization. A phylogenetic analysis reveals strong geographical structuring, with the greatest genetic diversity in Africa, and an independent origin for the two known genotypes that infect European bats. We also suggest that multiple genotypes may exist within the diversity of viruses currently classified as 'Lagos Bat'. In sum, we show that rigorous phylogenetic techniques based on full length genome sequence provide the best discriminatory power for genotype classification within the lyssaviruses.",2008,4,30,zover
371,10.1016/j.virusres.2010.09.007,"Characterization of Durham virus, a novel rhabdovirus that encodes both a C and SH protein","The family Rhabdoviridae is a diverse group of non-segmented, negative-sense RNA viruses that are distributed worldwide and infect a wide range of hosts including vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. Of the 114 currently recognized vertebrate rhabdoviruses, relatively few have been well characterized at both the antigenic and genetic level; hence, the phylogenetic relationships between many of the vertebrate rhabdoviruses remain unknown. The present report describes a novel rhabdovirus isolated from the brain of a moribund American coot (Fulica americana) that exhibited neurological signs when found in Durham County, North Carolina, in 2005. Antigenic characterization of the virus revealed that it was serologically unrelated to 68 other known vertebrate rhabdoviruses. Genomic sequencing of the virus indicated that it shared the highest identity to Tupaia rhabdovirus (TUPV), and as only previously observed in TUPV, the genome encoded a putative C protein in an overlapping open reading frame (ORF) of the phosphoprotein gene and a small hydrophobic (SH) protein located in a novel ORF between the matrix and glycoprotein genes. Phylogenetic analysis of partial amino acid sequences of the nucleoprotein and polymerase protein indicated that, in addition to TUPV, the virus was most closely related to avian and small mammal rhabdoviruses from Africa and North America. In this report, we present the morphological, pathological, antigenic, and genetic characterization of the new virus, tentatively named Durham virus (DURV), and discuss its potential evolutionary relationship to other vertebrate rhabdoviruses.",2011,1,NA,zover
372,10.1371/journal.pntd.0008113,"A long-distance translocation initiated an outbreak of raccoon rabies in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada","Despite proactive measures to prevent raccoon rabies entering Canada from the United States, several incursions of this disease have occurred. The largest outbreak, first reported in December 2015 in the city of Hamilton, Ontario, has resulted in the reporting of 449 animal cases as of December 31, 2018. Initial phylogenetic studies on the index case suggested that this outbreak was not due to local cross-border spread from the Niagara region of the United States where raccoon rabies has persisted for several years. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences of a viral collection from the Hamilton area and several US states indicates that a long-distance translocation of a diseased animal from southeastern New York State was responsible for this incursion. The role of the skunk as a potential secondary host supporting persistence and / or spread of the virus is also examined.",2020,3,25,zover

374,10.7589/0090-3558-40.4.617,MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TERRESTRIAL RABIES IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION,"Fifty-five rabies virus isolates originating from different regions of the former Soviet Union (FSU) were compared with isolates originating from Eurasia, Africa, and North America according to complete or partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences. The FSU isolates formed five distinct groups. Group A represented viruses originating from the Arctic, which were similar to viruses from Alaska and Canada. Group B consisted of ""Arctic-like"" viruses, originating from the south of East Siberia and the Far East. Group C consisted of viruses circulating in the steppe and forest-steppe territories from the European part of Russia to Tuva and in Kazakhstan. These three phylogenetic groups were clearly different from the European cluster. Viruses of group D circulate near the western border of Russia. Their phylogenetic position is intermediate between group C and the European cluster. Group E consisted of viruses originating from the northwestern part of Russia and comprised a ""northeastern Europe"" group described earlier from the Baltic region. According to surveillance data, a specific host can be defined clearly only for group A (arctic fox; Alopex lagopus) and for the Far Eastern part of the group B distribution area (raccoon dog; Nyctereutes procyonoides). For other territories and rabies virus variants, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the main virus reservoir. However, the steppe fox (Vulpes corsac), wolf (Canis lupus), and raccoon dog are also involved in virus circulation, depending on host population density. These molecular data, joined with surveillance information, demonstrate that the current fox rabies epizootic in the territory of the FSU developed independently of central and western Europe. No evidence of positive selection was found in the N genes of the isolates. In the glycoprotein gene, evidence of positive selection was strongly suggested in codons 156, 160, and 183. At these sites, no link between amino acid substitutions and phylogenetic placement or specific host species was detected.",2004,10,NA,zover
