10.1002/ajp.22046,Parasite Transmission Risk From Geophagic and Foraging Behavior in Chacma Baboons,numerous behavioral and ecological factors are associated with parasite transmission one factor explored in human research but absent from nonhuman primate research is parasite transmission from soil ingestion human studies suggest geophagy the regular and deliberate consumption of soil increases risk of soil transmitted helminth sth infection geophagy which is prevalent in nonhuman primates has several positive associations gastrointestinal distress alleviation possible mineral supplementation and bacterial infection prevention our objective was to determine whether sth transmission was possible from deliberate or accidental soil ingestion in a troop of chacma baboons papio hamadryas ursinus that engaged in geophagy foraged on the terrestrial substrata and had a trichuris sp sample prevalence of 100 we collected and analyzed 80 soil samples from geophagy and ground foraging sites on and around wildcliff nature reserve south africa forty soil samples were collected from sites where soil was consumed and 40 were collected from sites where soil was not consumed at geophagy sites the number of trichuris sp eggs recovered varied significantly between areas used and unused by the baboons suggesting behavior is an important factor in contrast at foraging sites there was only a tendency to recover more eggs at used than unused areas and we propose egg recovery was influenced by fecal contamination that occurred throughout foraging stands the difference in egg recovery between used areas at geophagy sites and used areas at foraging sites was not significant these preliminary findings suggest both geophagy and foraging sites are a potential source of sth infection for this troop whether geophagy benefits outweigh the potential cost of parasite reinfection for this baboon troop is unknown so we encourage future research on the influence that host foraging behavior may have on parasite reinfection,parasite
10.1038/hdy.2008.18,Heterozygosity and lungworm burden in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina),in several studies heterozygosity measured at around 10 microsatellite markers correlates with parasite load usually the effect size is small but while this may reflect reality it may also be possible that too few markers are used or the measure of fitness contains too much error to reveal what is actually a much stronger underlying effect here we analysed over 200 stranded harbour seals phoca vitulina for an association between lungworm burden and heterozygosity conducting thorough necropsies on the seals and genotyping the samples obtained for 27 microsatellites we found that homozygosity predicts higher worm burdens but only in young animals where the worms have the greatest impact on fitness testing each locus separately we found that a significant majority reveal a weak but similar trend for heterozygosity to be protective against high lungworm burden suggesting a genome wide effect that is inbreeding this conclusion is supported by the fact that heterozygosity is correlated among markers in young animals but not in otherwise equivalent older ones taken as a whole our results support the notion that homozygosity increases susceptibility to parasitic infection and suggest that parasites can be effective in removing inbred individuals from the population,parasite
