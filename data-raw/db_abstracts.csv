10.1002/(sici)1098-2345(199911)49:3<243::aid-ajp3>3.0.co;2-4,in order to obtain reliable evidence for differences in habitat preferences between two closely related savanna dwelling primate species namely patas monkeys erythrocebus patas and tantalus monkeys cercopithecus aethiops tantalus i collected data on vegetation and patterns of range use concurrently at a single study site kala maloue cameroon in a similar manner for a group of each species kala maloue consisted of 64 grassland mostly dominated by gramineae spp and the rest was woodland tantalus monkeys showed preference for woodland especially gallery forest much more than did the patas irrespective of the season moreover patas preferentially established their home range in grassland in the wet season interspecific and seasonal differences in habitat preferences could be interpreted on the basis of interspecific and seasonal differences in preferences for main food in dry season tantalus utilized water containing areas at a frequency closely in proportion to the availability of such areas while the patas utilized water containing areas more frequently than expected this is because tantalus established a smaller home range along the river where water was never completely depleted throughout the dry season both the patas and the tantalus preferred woodland to grassland as sleeping sites possibly owing to predation avoidance both the daily travel distance per group weight and the home range size per group weight were greater for patas than for tantalus partly because of higher preference for grassland with low habitat quality in the case of patas it is suggested however that high locomotive ability enabled patas to effectively utilize small and widely dispersed items of food such as grasshoppers and to explore areas with high availability of food and water and with preferable sleeping sites,gmpd,1817
10.1002/(sici)1522-2683(19990601)20:7<1486::aid-elps1486>3.0.co;2-9,we exploited the high resolution capacity of polymerase chain reaction pcr coupled single strand conformation polymorphism sscp to screen for sequence variation in the second internal transcribed spacer its 2 of ribosomal dna rdna among 77 individuals representing oesophagostumum bifurcum from human or mona monkey hosts from africa sscp analysis revealed distinct profiles among some of the individuals and sequence analysis of representative samples defined different its 2 sequence types attributable to polymorphism at particular nucleotide positions however there was no unequivocal sequence difference between o bifurcum individuals from humans and that from monkeys this provided some support for the hypothesis that the parasite from the two hosts represents a single species and that the sequence microheterogeneity detected in the its 2 rdna region represents population variation although the findings were insufficient to reject the proposal that the parasite represents different species overall the results showed the usefulness of the sscp sequencing approach for studying the genetic variation in o bifurcum populations and indicated its potential to study macromolecular evolution and elucidate population differentiation at the molecular level,gmpd,1262
10.1002/1522-2683(200106)22:10<1930::aid-elps1930>3.0.co;2-z,this study examined genetic variation among specimens of contracaecum ogmorhini from different otariid hosts and geographical origins using a polymerase chain reaction pcr based mutation detection approach the first its 1 and second its 2 internal transcribed spacers its of ribosomal dna rdna were amplified individually by pcr scanned for sequence variation by single strand conformation polymorphism sscp and samples displaying variable sscp profiles were subjected to cycle sequencing while c ogmorhini individuals from arctocephalus pusillus pusillus coapp from south africa and those from arctocephalus pusillus doriferus coapd from australia had very similar sscp profiles for both its 1 and its 2 individuals of c ogmorhini from zalophus californianus cozc from pacific canada could be unequivocally distinguished based on their profiles in accordance with sscp results both coapp and coapd had identical its consensus sequences whereas cozc differed in sequence from both coapp and coapd populations by 0 2 one base in the its 1 and 0 7 two bases in the its 2 based on the nucleotide difference in the its 2 sequence a pcr linked restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp could be employed to distinguish individuals representing cozc from those of both coapp and coapd the findings suggest that c ogmorhini may represent a complex of at least two species,gmpd,1368
10.1002/ajp.1008,among over 40 mammal species threatened by the filling of a hydroelectric dam reservoir in french guiana three species of primates have been translocated comprising 124 red howler monkeys six white faced sakis and 95 golden handed tamarins health status of the animals was evaluated by direct physical examination and by hematological biochemical virological and parasitological surveys of collected blood the physical condition of the howlers was slightly worse toward the end of the capture period but that of sakis and tamarins remained satisfactory several ectoparasites ticks larvae of dipterous insects fleas and lice were collected and various wounds apparently nondebilitating were recorded in howlers hematological and biochemical profiles determined for the three species revealed a slight anemia in howlers entamoeba strongyloides and trypanoxyurus were common in fecal samples of howlers a survey of blood smears from the three species revealed infection by several types of microfilaria trypanosoma rangeli like and plasmodium brasilianum in all three and trypanosoma cruzi like in howlers these infections had no significant impact on the health status or the hematological profiles serologic investigations revealed occasional reactions against toxoplasma gondii a strong anti plasmodium response in the two cebidae species and a weaker one in tamarins attempts to isolate arbovirus failed but antibody responses to mayaro and yellow fever viruses were strong especially in the howlers a strong correlation between age and serological status led to a better understanding of the epidemic cycles our survey indicates french guianan primates are reservoirs for several anthropozoonoses including malaria chagas disease and arboviruses,gmpd,1747
10.1002/ajp.1042,we monitored the birth patterns of sympatric brown howler monkeys alouatta fusca clamitans and northern muriquis brachyteles arachnoides hypoxanthus during a 4 yr period from october 1996 to august 2000 at the estação biológica de caratinga minas gerais brazil brown howler monkey births n 34 occurred throughout the year and birth frequencies did not differ between rainy and dry season months the aseasonal birth patterns of the howler monkeys differed significantly from the dry season concentration and dry month peak in muriqui births n 23 we found no effects of infant sex or the number of females on interbirth intervals ibis in our 10 howler monkey study troops ibis of brown howler monkeys averaged 21 2 2 5 mo n 8 median 21 0 mo and were significantly shorter following dry season births than rainy season births their ibis and yearling survivorship 74 were similar to those reported for other species of howler monkeys but yearling survivorship was much lower than that of muriquis 94 whose ibis were more than 12 mo longer than those of the howler monkeys our study extends comparative knowledge of birth patterns in alouatta to a poorly known species and provides insights into the different ways in which diet and life history may affect the timing of births in large bodied platyrrhines under the same seasonal ecological conditions,gmpd,1347
10.1002/ajp.1350170204,experimental and clinical parasitology need natural baselines or controls we present normative data intestinal parasite loads in two genera of african primates wild pan troglodytes and papio spp were studied at two sites gombe in tanzania p anubis and mt assirik in senegal p papio presence or absence of parasites especially nematodes was recorded from fecal specimens gombe s primates were more often infected than were mt assirik s at gombe but not at mt assirik chimpanzees seemed to have a higher incidence of infection than baboons comparison of three baboon troops yielded apparent differences in prevalence of infection no differences in infection were found between the wet and dry seasons in mt assirik s chimpanzees,gmpd,726
10.1002/ajp.1350180304,three troops of olive baboons papio anubis comprising 134 animals were captured during a translocation program all three troops phg crip wby lived in high altitude savannah but two crip and wby also frequented human settlements where they had access to the garbage pits and vegetable gardens the translocation offered the opportunity to compare body condition activity patterns and parasitism among the troops of animals a variety of body measurements were taken a physical examination performed activity patterns for the previous 2 years enumerated and blood and feces collected for virological and parasitological analyses body condition as judged qualitatively by appearance and quantitatively by subcutaneous fat thickness and body weight was lowest in phg the naturally foraging troop all animals were negative for all viruses no blood borne parasites were found but the feces of the majority of animals were positive for eggs of strongyles ascarids trichuris spp and strongyloides spp quantification of strongyles indicated the heaviest burdens were in the non provisioned troop phg these results when combined with the behavioral observations that phg spent more time foraging and less time resting or socializing than wby suggest lowered availability and or a poorer quality of phg s diet the data support the hypothesis of a causal relationship between host nutrition and helminth parasite infection but do not permit general conclusions to be drawn on mechanisms of interaction,gmpd,1487
10.1002/ajp.1350370404,leaf swallowing by chimpanzees pan troglodytes has been hypothesized to control parasites but it has not yet been shown to be associated with specific parasitic infections this report takes advantage of a tapeworm infestation among wild chimpanzees to examine whether leaf swallowing was associated with the presence of tapeworms leaf swallowing was monitored over 6 5 years in two chimpanzee communities in kibale national park uganda in one community tape worms bertiella studeri were found only during a seven month period when they occurred in every month during this period leaf swallowing occurred at an unusually high rate and dungs that contained tapeworm fragments tended to contain whole leaves these data suggest that tape worm infections increased the rate at which chimpanzees swallowed whole leaves however this does not mean that tapeworms were necessarily controlled as a result 1995 wiley liss inc,gmpd,914
10.1002/ajp.20041,prolonged habituation times for wild great apes delay the collection of behavioral and environmental data sometimes for years however genotyping of noninvasively collected feces can provide useful socioecological information in the meantime we tested this premise on an unhabituated wild population of western chimpanzees pan troglodytes verus at mont assirik senegal genotyping yielded information on kinship group size party size and composition sex ratio and ranging,gmpd,469
10.1002/ajp.20106,numerous intestinal parasites identified in populations of wild nonhuman primates can be pathogenic to humans furthermore nonhuman primates are susceptible to a variety of human pathogens because of increasing human encroachment into previously nonimpacted forests and the potential for disease transmission between human and nonhuman primate populations further detailed investigations of primate ecological parasitology are warranted for meaningful comparisons to be made it is important for methods to be standardized across study sites one aspect of methodological standardization is providing reliable estimates of parasite prevalence and knowing how many samples are needed to adequately estimate an individual s parasite prevalence in this study the parasitic fauna of 37 adult adolescent and juvenile male chimpanzees from the ngogo group kibale national park uganda were assessed from 121 fecal samples collected over a 3 month period twelve taxa of intestinal species five helminth and seven protozoan were recovered from the samples the four most prevalent species were troglodytella abrassarti 97 3 oesophagostomum sp 81 1 strongyloides sp 83 8 and entamoeba chattoni 70 3 no one species was found in all samples from any one animal and troglodytella abrassarti the most common intestinal organism was found in all of the serial samples of only 69 4 of the chimpanzees the cumulative species richness for individuals significantly increased for every sequential sample up to three to four samples taken per animal during this study the results indicate that to accurately diagnose total intestinal infection and evaluate group prevalence three to four sequential samples from each individual must be collected on nonconsecutive days this conclusion applies only to short study periods in which possible seasonal effects are not taken into consideration validation of these results at different study sites in different regions with different climatic patterns is needed,gmpd,1981
10.1002/ajp.20181,factors that influence proximity and the number and duration of contacts among individuals can influence parasite transmission among hosts and thus parasite prevalence and species richness are expected to increase with increasing host density to examine this prediction we took advantage of a unique situation following the clearing of a forest fragment that supported red colobus piliocolobus tephrosceles and black and white colobus colobus guereza the animals moved into a neighboring fragment that we had been monitoring for a number of years and for which we had described the primate parasite community after the animals immigrated into the fragment the colobus populations more than doubled and colobus density became almost twice that found in kibale national park uganda despite this increase in host density the richness of the parasite community did not increase however in both colobus species the prevalence of trichuris sp the only commonly occurring gastrointestinal parasite increased over the next 5 years the prevalence and intensity of infection of trichuris sp in red colobus declined and their population numbers slowly increased in contrast the prevalence and intensity of infection of trichuris sp increased in black and white colobus and remained high following the immigration and their population size declined while trichuris sp infections are typically asymptomatic we consider it a possibility that they contributed to the decline of the black and white colobus and that the red colobus may be serving as a reservoir for trichuris thereby increasing the infection risk for black and white colobus,gmpd,1625
10.1002/ajp.20233,humans are responsible for massive changes to primate habitats and one unanticipated consequence of these alterations may be changes in host parasite interactions edges are a ubiquitous aspect of human disturbance to forest landscapes here we examine how changes associated with the creation of edges in kibale national park uganda alter the parasite community that is supported by two species of african colobines the endangered red colobus piliocolobus tephrosceles and the black and white colobus colobus guereza an analysis of 822 fecal samples from edge and forest interior groups revealed no difference in the richness of parasite communities i e the number of parasite species recovered from the host s fecal sample however for both species the proportion of individuals with multiple infections was greater in edge than forest interior groups the prevalence of specific parasites also varied between edge and forest interior groups oesophagostomum sp a potentially deleterious parasite was 7 4 times more prevalent in red colobus on the edge than in those in the forest interior and entamoeba coli was four times more prevalent in red colobus on the edge than in animals from the forest interior environmental contamination with parasites measured as parasite eggs gm feces by red colobus from the edge and forest interior differed in a similar fashion to prevalence for red colobus but it did not differ for black and white colobus for example egg counts of oesophagostomum sp were 10 times higher in red colobus from the edge than in those from the interior the less severe infections in the black and white colobus relative to the red colobus may reflect the fact that black and white colobus raid agricultural crops while red colobus do not this nutritional gain may facilitate a more effective immune response to parasites by the black and white colobus the fact that animals on the edge are likely not nutritionally stressed raises an intriguing question as to what facilitates the elevated infections in edge animals we speculate that interactions with humans may be linked to the observed patterns of infections and hence that understanding the ecology of infectious diseases in nonhuman primates is of paramount importance for conservation and potentially for human health planning,gmpd,2298
10.1002/ajp.20298,during the period of december 2004 to january 2005 bacillus anthracis killed three wild chimpanzees pan troglodytes troglodytes and one gorilla gorilla gorilla gorilla in a tropical forest in cameroon while this is the second anthrax outbreak in wild chimpanzees this is the first case of anthrax in gorillas ever reported the number of great apes in central africa is dramatically declining and the populations are seriously threatened by diseases mainly ebola nevertheless a considerable number of deaths cannot be attributed to ebola virus and remained unexplained our results show that diseases other than ebola may also threaten wild great apes and indicate that the role of anthrax in great ape mortality may have been underestimated these results suggest that risk identification assessment and management for the survival of the last great apes should be performed with an open mind since various pathogens with distinct characteristics in epidemiology and pathogenicity may impact the populations an animal mortality monitoring network covering the entire african tropical forest with the dual aims of preventing both great ape extinction and human disease outbreaks will create necessary baseline data for such risk assessments and management plans,gmpd,1258
10.1002/ajp.20309,parasites are important members of the ecological web within which an animal lives and can be used as indicators of ecosystem health however few baseline parasitological data are available for free ranging animals particularly for the black howler monkey alouatta pigra in this study a total of 283 fecal samples were collected from 50 individually identified a pigra during 2003 and 2004 and examined for parasites the samples were processed using standard quantitative centrifugation concentration techniques with sugar and zinc sulfate used as flotation media the slides were examined using bright field and phase microscopy antigen capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assays elisas were used to detect protozoa four parasites were detected 1 controrchis biliophilus dicrocoeliidae 2 trypanoxyuris minutus oxyuridae 3 giardia sp hexamitidae and 4 entamoeba sp endamoebidae controrchis biliophilus was detected in 80 wet season and 81 dry season of the a pigra samples trypanoxyuris minutus was detected in 8 wet season and 27 dry season of samples and giardia sp was detected in 40 wet season and 27 dry season of samples for the first time dna from giardia sp positive fecal samples was extracted from a pigra alouatta pigra individuals that lived near human settlements in belize were infected with giardia duodenalis syn g lamblia g intestinalis assemblages a and b these results suggest that g duodenalis is transmitted from people and or domestic animals to a pigra,gmpd,1473
10.1002/ajp.20573,understanding the rates and causes of mortality in wild chimpanzee populations has important implications for a variety of fields including wildlife conservation and human evolution because chimpanzees are long lived accurate mortality data requires very long term studies here we analyze 47 years of data on the kasekela community in gombe national park community size fluctuated between 38 and 60 containing 60 individuals in 2006 from records on 220 chimpanzees and 130 deaths we found that the most important cause of mortality in the kasekela community was illness 58 of deaths with known cause followed by intraspecific aggression 20 of deaths with known cause previous studies at other sites also found that illness was the primary cause of mortality and that some epidemic disease could be traced to humans as at other study sites most deaths due to illness occurred during epidemics and the most common category of disease was respiratory intraspecific lethal aggression occurred within the community including the killing of infants by both males and females and among adult males during the course of dominance related aggression aggression between communities resulted in the deaths of at least five adult males and two adult females in the kasekela and kahama communities the frequency of intercommunity violence appears to vary considerably among sites and over time intercommunity lethal aggression involving the kasekela community was observed most frequently during two periods other less common causes of death included injury loss of mother maternal disability and poaching,gmpd,1592
10.1002/ajp.20601,if stress and disease impose fitness costs and if those costs vary as a function of group size then stress and disease should exert selection pressures on group size we assessed the relationships between group size stress and parasite infections across nine groups of red colobus monkeys procolobus rufomitratus in kibale national park uganda we used fecal cortisol as a measure of physiological stress and examined fecal samples to assess the prevalence and intensity of gastrointestinal helminth infections we also examined the effect of behaviors that could potentially reduce parasite transmission e g increasing group spread and reducing social interactions we found that cortisol was not significantly related to group size but parasite prevalence was negatively related to group size and group spread the observed increase in group spread could have reduced the rate of parasite transmission in larger groups however it is not clear whether this was a density dependent behavioral counter strategy to infection or a response to food competition that also reduced parasite transmission the results do not support the suggestion that gastrointestinal parasitism or stress directly imposed group size related fitness costs and we cannot conclude that they are among the mechanisms limiting group size in red colobus monkeys,gmpd,1327
10.1002/ajp.20603,early learning about edible food in the environment is a critical survival task for young nonhuman primates social learning and social facilitation are often cited to explain how youngsters learn to select and find their food in this framework we observed eight mother youngster pairs of free ranging japanese macaques divided into two sets according to the age of the young infants aged between 7 and 12 months and juveniles aged between 1 5 and 2 years during three winter months we systematically investigated the intensive observation directed by the youngsters toward elders by recording the target s identity e g mother subadult the items manipulated by the elder and those items closely observed by the youngster along with the behavior of the youngster preceding and immediately following an intensive observation period the diet of the mothers and juveniles was estimated from time records of each feeding occurrence for each food item identified to species level and from the quantity of fresh matter ingested the results show that intensive observation by both infants and juveniles were directed toward those elders engaged in plant and invertebrate foraging such behavior was age dependent being more frequent in infants than in juveniles the majority of the intensive observations were directed toward the mother intensive observations also shaped a change in the behavior of infants by significantly stimulating the investigation of food items and locations otherwise not investigated by juveniles moreover infants showed a particular interest in rare food items and especially invertebrates age differences between the two sets of young and their interest in rare foods are discussed with reference to the occurrence of intensive observation within the framework of kin relationships social organization and social transmission of information about food type and food location and its survival values,gmpd,1916
10.1002/ajp.20796,two yellow fever outbreaks yfos occurred in northeastern argentina between november 2007 and october 2008 seriously affecting populations of two howler monkey species the brown howler alouatta guariba clamitans and the black howler alouatta caraya both howlers live syntopically in el piñalito provincial park misiones where four groups 36 individuals were studied since january 2005 the first dead howlers were found on january 20 2008 in el piñalito systematic searches found 14 dead howlers within the area 12 from the study groups and two from neighboring groups with only two young seen on january 25 2008 and none found since up to december 2008 in october 2008 another yfo hit howler monkey populations from el soberbio misiones overall 59 howlers were found dead in misiones from november 2007 to december 2008 thanks to the alert of the howler s death in el piñalito a prompt human vaccination campaign started in the area wild howler monkey populations from both species are in a delicate situation in misiones especially the brown howler an already endangered species in argentina and endemic to the atlantic forest if we add the recurrence of yfos to the reduction of suitable habitat to small fragments it could be only a matter of time until howler populations disappear from the upper paraná atlantic forest in misiones,gmpd,1334
10.1002/ajp.20803,exponential expansion of human populations and human activities within primate habitats has resulted in high potential for pathogen exchange creating challenges for biodiversity conservation and global health under such conditions resilient habitat generalists such as black and gold howler monkeys alouatta caraya may act as effective sentinels to overall ecosystem health and alert us to impending epidemics in the human population to better understand this potential we examined noninvasively collected fecal samples from black and gold howler monkeys from remote rural and village populations in northern argentina we examined all samples n 90 for the zoonotic protozoa cryptosporidium sp and giardia sp via immunofluorescent antibody ifa detection all samples were negative for cryptosporidium sp the prevalence of giardia sp was significantly higher at the rural site 67 compared with the remote forest 57 and village 40 sites a lack of cryptosporidium sp in all samples examined suggests that this pathogen is not a natural component of the howler parasite communities at these sites and that current land use patterns and livestock contact are not exposing argentine howler monkeys to this pathogen high prevalence of giardia sp at all sites suggests that howler monkeys may serve as a viable reservoir for giardia significantly higher prevalence of giardia sp at the rural site where primate livestock contact is highest suggests the presence of multiple giardia clades or increased exposure to giardia through repeated zoonotic transmission among nonhuman primates livestock and or people these results highlight the need for future research into the epidemiology cross species transmission ecology and clinical consequences of giardia and other infectious agents not only in humans and livestock but also in the wild animals that share their environments,gmpd,1865
10.1002/ajp.20847,as undisturbed habitat becomes increasingly rare managers charged with ensuring the survival of endangered primate species must increasingly utilize disturbed and degraded habitats in species survival plans yet we have an imperfect understanding of the true long term viability of primate populations in disturbed habitat and census data can be misleading because density is not necessarily correlated with habitat quality and population viability in predictable ways here we present clinical laboratory data on hematology serum biochemistry fat soluble vitamins minerals iron analytes viral serology and parasitology of diademed sifaka propithecus diadema derived from the capture of 26 individuals spanning eight groups and two habitats undisturbed vs disturbed and fragmented at tsinjoarivo madagascar blood from fragment individuals had significantly lower values for several factors white blood cell counts bilirubin total protein albumin calcium sodium chloride manganese zinc iron and total iron binding capacity several biochemical variables were higher in immature individuals probably due to active growth the large number of interhabitat differences suggests that habitat disturbance has an impact on physiological health within this population perhaps reflecting dietary stress and or immunosuppression these results combined with previous data showing altered diet slower juvenile growth and reduced activity in disturbed forest fragments suggest that fragment sifakas may be less healthy than continuous forest groups finally tsinjoarivo sifakas have extremely low blood urea nitrogen perhaps reflecting protein limitation and selenium levels relative to other lemurs despite their survival and reproduction in the short term in fragments these sifakas may represent a riskier conservation investment than conspecifics in undisturbed forest and may be more susceptible to environmental stressors however more data on the fitness consequences of these biochemical differences are needed for a better interpretation of their impacts on long term viability prospects,gmpd,2077
10.1002/ajp.20884,the exponential decline of great apes over the past 50 years has resulted in an urgent need for data to inform population viability assessment and conservation strategies health monitoring of remaining ape populations is an important component of this process in support of this effort we examined endoparasitic and commensal prevalence and richness as proxies of population health for western chimpanzees pan troglodytes verus and sympatric guinea baboons papio hamadryas papio at fongoli senegal a site dominated by woodland savanna at the northwestern extent of chimpanzees geographic range the small population size and extreme environmental pressures experienced by fongoli chimpanzees make them particularly sensitive to the potential impact of pathogens one hundred thirty two chimpanzee and seventeen baboon fecal samples were processed using sodium nitrate floatation and fecal sedimentation to isolate helminth eggs larvae and protozoal cysts six nematodes physaloptera sp ascaris sp stronglyloides fuelleborni trichuris sp an unidentified hookworm and an unidentified larvated nematode one cestode bertiella sp and five protozoans iodamoeba buetschlii entamoeba coli troglodytella abrassarti troglocorys cava and an unidentified ciliate were detected in chimpanzee fecal samples four nematodes necator sp s fuelleborni trichuris sp and an unidentified hookworm sp two trematodes shistosoma mansoni and an unidentified fluke and six protozoans entamoeba histolytica dispar e coli chilomastix mesnili balantidium coli t abrassarti and t cava were detected in baboon fecal samples the low prevalence of pathogenic parasite species and high prevalence of symbiotic protozoa in fongoli chimpanzees are indicative of good overall population health however the high prevalence of pathogenic parasites in baboons who may serve as transport hosts highlight the need for ongoing pathogen surveillance of the fongoli chimpanzee population and point to the need for further research into the epidemiology and cross species transmission ecology of zoonotic pathogens at this site,gmpd,2077
10.1002/ajp.20992,a series of articles by w j freeland published in the 1970s proposed that social organization and behavioral processes were heavily influenced by parasitic infections which led to a number of intriguing hypotheses concerning how natural selection might act on social factors because of the benefits of avoiding parasite infections for example freeland 1979 showed that all individuals within a given group harbored identical gastrointestinal protozoan faunas which led him to postulate that social groups were akin to biological islands and suggest how this isolation could select specific types of ranging and dispersal patterns here we reexamine the biological island hypothesis by quantifying the protozoan faunas of the same primate species examined by freeland in the same location our results do not support this hypothesis in contrast we quantified two general changes in protozoan parasite community of primates in the study area of kibale national park uganda over the nearly 35 years between sample collections 1 the colobines found free of parasites in the early 1970s are now infected with numerous intestinal protozoan parasites and 2 groups are no longer biological islands in terms of their protozoan parasites whatever the ultimate explanation for these changes our findings have implications for studies proposing selective forces shaping primate behavior and social organization,gmpd,1396
10.1002/ajp.22040,differences in group size and habitat use are frequently used to explain the extensive variability in ranging patterns found across the primate order however with few exceptions our understanding of primate ranging patterns stems from studies of single groups and both intra and inter specific meta analyses studies with many groups and those that incorporate whole populations are rare but important for testing socioecological theory in primates we quantify the ranging patterns of nine chacma baboon troops in a single population and use spearman rank correlations and generalized linear mixed models to analyze the effects of troop size and human modified habitat a proxy for good quality habitat on home range size density individuals km 2 and daily path length intrapopulation variation in home range sizes 1 5 37 7 km 2 densities 1 3 12 1 baboons km 2 and daily path lengths 1 80 6 61 km was so vast that values were comparable to those of baboons inhabiting the climatic extremes of their current distribution both troop size and human modified habitat had an effect on ranging patterns larger troops had larger home ranges and longer daily path lengths while troops that spent more time in human modified habitat had shorter daily path lengths we found no effect of human modified habitat on home range size or density these results held when we controlled for the effects of both a single large outlier troop living exclusively in human modified habitat and baboon monitors on our spatial variables our findings confirm the ability of baboons as behaviorally adaptable dietary generalists to not only survive but also to thrive in human modified habitats with adjustments to their ranging patterns in accordance with current theory our findings also caution that studies focused on only a small sample of groups within a population of adaptable and generalist primate species may underestimate the variability in their respective localities,gmpd,1950
10.1002/ajp.22046,numerous behavioral and ecological factors are associated with parasite transmission one factor explored in human research but absent from nonhuman primate research is parasite transmission from soil ingestion human studies suggest geophagy the regular and deliberate consumption of soil increases risk of soil transmitted helminth sth infection geophagy which is prevalent in nonhuman primates has several positive associations gastrointestinal distress alleviation possible mineral supplementation and bacterial infection prevention our objective was to determine whether sth transmission was possible from deliberate or accidental soil ingestion in a troop of chacma baboons papio hamadryas ursinus that engaged in geophagy foraged on the terrestrial substrata and had a trichuris sp sample prevalence of 100 we collected and analyzed 80 soil samples from geophagy and ground foraging sites on and around wildcliff nature reserve south africa forty soil samples were collected from sites where soil was consumed and 40 were collected from sites where soil was not consumed at geophagy sites the number of trichuris sp eggs recovered varied significantly between areas used and unused by the baboons suggesting behavior is an important factor in contrast at foraging sites there was only a tendency to recover more eggs at used than unused areas and we propose egg recovery was influenced by fecal contamination that occurred throughout foraging stands the difference in egg recovery between used areas at geophagy sites and used areas at foraging sites was not significant these preliminary findings suggest both geophagy and foraging sites are a potential source of sth infection for this troop whether geophagy benefits outweigh the potential cost of parasite reinfection for this baboon troop is unknown so we encourage future research on the influence that host foraging behavior may have on parasite reinfection,gmpd,1919
10.1002/ajp.22379,parasitism is expected to impact host morbidity or mortality although the fitness costs of parasitism have rarely been quantified for wildlife hosts tapeworms in the genus taenia exploit a variety of vertebrates including livestock humans and geladas theropithecus gelada monkeys endemic to the alpine grasslands of ethiopia despite taenia s adverse societal and economic impacts we know little about the prevalence of disease associated with taenia infection in wildlife or the impacts of this disease on host health mortality and reproduction we monitored geladas at guassa ethiopia over a continuous 6 year period for external evidence cysts or coenuri of taenia associated disease coenurosis and evaluated the impact of coenurosis on host survival and reproduction we also identified through genetic and histological analyses the tapeworms causing coenurosis in wild geladas at guassa as taenia serialis nearly 1 3 of adult geladas at guassa possessed 1 coenurus at some point in the study coenurosis adversely impacted gelada survival and reproduction at guassa and this impact spanned two generations adults with coenuri suffered higher mortality than members of their sex without coenuri and offspring of females with coenuri also suffered higher mortality coenurosis also negatively affected adult reproduction lengthening interbirth intervals and reducing the likelihood that males successfully assumed reproductive control over units of females our study provides the first empirical evidence that coenurosis increases mortality and reduces fertility in wild nonhuman primate hosts our research highlights the value of longitudinal monitoring of individually recognized animals in natural populations for advancing knowledge of parasite host evolutionary dynamics and offering clues to the etiology and control of infectious disease,gmpd,1842
10.1002/ajpa.10315,there is a well documented relationship between development and other life history parameters among anthropoid primates smaller bodied anthropoids tend to mature more rapidly than do larger bodied species among anthropoids of similar body sizes folivorous species tend to grow and mature more quickly than do frugivorous species thus attaining adult body size at an earlier age this pattern conforms to the expectations of janson and van schaik s ecological risk aversion hypothesis which predicts that rates of growth and maturation should vary in inverse relation to the intensity of intraspecific feeding competition according to the ecological risk aversion hypothesis rah species experiencing high intraspecific feeding competition will grow and mature slowly to reduce the risk of mortality due to food shortages species experiencing low levels of intraspecific feeding competition will shorten the juvenile period to reduce the overall duration of this high risk portion of the life cycle this paper focuses on development and maturation in lemurs we show that folivorous lemurs such as indriids grow and mature more slowly than like sized frugivorous lemurs e g most lemurids but tend to exhibit faster dental development their dental developmental schedules are accelerated on an absolute scale relative to craniofacial growth and relative to particular life history landmarks such as weaning dental development has a strong phylogenetic component even those lemurids that consume substantial amounts of foliage have slower dental development than those indriids that consume substantial amounts of fruit implications of these results for the rah are discussed and an explanation for this hypothesis failure to predict lemur growth schedules is offered we propose that the differing developmental schedules of folivorous and frugivorous lemurs may reflect different solutions to the ecological problem of environmental instability some rely on a strategy of low maternal input and slow returns while others rely on a strategy of high maternal input and fast returns,gmpd,2074
10.1002/ajpa.20477,identifying factors that influence animal density is a fundamental goal in ecology that has taken on new importance with the need to develop informed management plans this is particularly the case for primates as the tropical forest that supports many species is being rapidly converted we use a system of forest fragments adjacent to kibale national park uganda to examine if food availability and parasite infections have synergistic affects on red colobus piliocolobus tephrosceles abundance given that the size of primate populations can often respond slowly to environmental changes we also examined how these factors influenced cortisol levels to meet these objectives we monitored gastrointestinal parasites evaluated fecal cortisol levels and determined changes in food availability by conducting complete tree inventories in eight fragments in 2000 and 2003 red colobus populations declined by an average of 21 among the fragments however population change ranged from a 25 increase to a 57 decline the cumulative basal area of food trees declined by an average of 29 5 however forest change was highly variable a 2 gain to a 71 decline we found that nematode prevalence averaged 58 among fragments range 29 83 the change in colobus population size was correlated both with food availability and a number of indices of parasite infections a path analysis suggests that change in food availability has a strong direct effect on population size but it also has an indirect effect via parasite infections,gmpd,1510
10.1002/ajpa.20664,the need to develop conservation plans calls for the ability to identify ecological factors that influence population density because stress is known to affect fecundity and mortality increasing stress may provide a warning of potential population declines we examined the effects of temporal variation in nutrition and parasitism on stress in endangered red colobus monkeys in kibale national park uganda first we tested the hypothesis that parasitism and nutrition would individually affect stress levels we found that periods of poor quality diet corresponded with an increase in cortisol similarly increases in parasite infections were associated with increased cortisol next we predicted that a poor quality diet would facilitate increased parasite infections and that together they would lead to amplified stress however we found no support for such amplification likely because the quality of the diet had little effect on parasite infections third we tested whether individuals in a larger group were subject to food stress due to greater within group competition which would intensify nutritional stress and parasitism and lead to reduced reproduction although we found no evidence to support a group size effect on parasites cortisol levels in the large group tended to be higher than those in the small group and the large group had fewer infants per female the results suggest that parasitism and poor nutrition lead to increased stress which because they are known to be associated with reduced fecundity and increased mortality may lead to population declines,gmpd,1573
10.1002/ajpa.21098,parasite richness and prevalence in wild animals can be used as indicators of population and ecosystem health in this study the gastrointestinal parasites of ursine colobus monkeys colobus vellerosus at the boabeng fiema monkey sanctuary bfms ghana were investigated bfms is a sacred grove where monkeys and humans have long lived in relatively peaceful proximity fecal samples n 109 were collected opportunistically from 27 adult and subadult males in six bisexual groups and one all male band from july 2004 to august 2005 using fecal floatation we detected three protozoans two entamoeba sp isospora sp five nematodes ascaris sp enterobius sp trichuris sp two strongyle sp and one digenean trematode using fluorescein labeled antibodies we detected an additional protozoan giardia sp and with pcr techniques we characterized this as g duodenalis assemblage b and also identified a protistan blastocystis sp subtype 2 the most prevalent parasite species were g duodenalis and trichuris sp parasites were more prevalent in the long wet season than the long dry parasite prevalence did not vary by age and average parasite richness did not differ by rank for males whose status remained unchanged however males that changed rank tended to show higher average parasite richness when they were lower ranked individuals that spent more time near human settlements had a higher prevalence of isospora sp that morphologically resembled the human species i belli the presence of this parasite and g duodenalis assemblage b indicates possible anthropozoonotic and or zoonotic transmission between humans and colobus monkeys at this site,gmpd,1629
10.1002/ajpa.21243,parasites and infectious diseases represent ecological forces shaping animal social evolution although empirical studies supporting this link abound in various vertebrate orders both the study of the dynamics and impact of parasite infections and infectious diseases in strepsirrhine primates have received little empirical attention we conducted a longitudinal parasitological study on four groups of wild red fronted lemurs eulemur fulvus rufus at kirindy forest madagascar during two field seasons in consecutive years to investigate i the degree of gastrointestinal parasite infection on population and individual levels and ii factors potentially determining individual infection risk using a comprehensive dataset with multiple individually assignable parasite samples as well as information on age sex group size social rank and endocrine status fecal androgen and glucocorticoid we examined parasite infection patterns and host traits that may affect individual infection risk in addition we examined whether parasite infection affects mating and reproductive success our results indicated high variability in parasite infection on individual and population levels time of year and group size was important determinants of variability in parasite infection variation in hormone levels was also associated with parasite species richness and parasite infection intensity differences in parasite infection between years indicate a potential immune enhancing function of steroid hormones on nematode infections which has not been reported before from other vertebrates studied under natural conditions male mating and reproductive success were not correlated to any measure of parasite infection which suggests a nonfunctional role of the parasites we examined in primate sexual selection,gmpd,1792

10.1038/hdy.2008.18,in several studies heterozygosity measured at around 10 microsatellite markers correlates with parasite load usually the effect size is small but while this may reflect reality it may also be possible that too few markers are used or the measure of fitness contains too much error to reveal what is actually a much stronger underlying effect here we analysed over 200 stranded harbour seals phoca vitulina for an association between lungworm burden and heterozygosity conducting thorough necropsies on the seals and genotyping the samples obtained for 27 microsatellites we found that homozygosity predicts higher worm burdens but only in young animals where the worms have the greatest impact on fitness testing each locus separately we found that a significant majority reveal a weak but similar trend for heterozygosity to be protective against high lungworm burden suggesting a genome wide effect that is inbreeding this conclusion is supported by the fact that heterozygosity is correlated among markers in young animals but not in otherwise equivalent older ones taken as a whole our results support the notion that homozygosity increases susceptibility to parasitic infection and suggest that parasites can be effective in removing inbred individuals from the population,gmpd,1277

10.1890/07-0995.1,epidemiological studies typically focus on single parasite systems although most hosts harbor multiple parasite species thus the potential impacts of co infection on disease dynamics are only beginning to be recognized interactions between macroparasites such as gastrointestinal nematodes and microparasites causing diseases like tb aids and malaria are particularly interesting because co infection may favor transmission and progression of these important diseases here we present evidence for strong interactions between gastrointestinal worms and bovine tuberculosis tb in free ranging african buffalo syncerus caffer tb and worms are negatively associated at the population among herd and within herd scales and this association is not solely the result of demographic heterogeneities in infection combining data from 1362 buffalo with simple mechanistic models we find that both accelerated mortality of co infected individuals and tb transmission heterogeneity caused by trade offs in immunity to the two types of parasites likely contribute to observed infection patterns this study is one of the first to examine the relevance of within host immunological trade offs for understanding parasite distribution patterns in natural populations,gmpd,1248

10.1182/blood.v126.23.537.537,abstractbackground hepcidin is a 25 amino acid peptide that binds to ferroportin and causes internalization and degradation of the hepcidin ferroportin complex leading to decreased iron absorption and reduced iron export from reticuloendothelial cells high hepcidin levels are found in cancer patients pts and implicated in anemia pathogenesis it is hypothesized that neutralizing hepcidin with a monoclonal antibody mab will prevent internalization of ferroportin restore iron efflux from cells and allow transferrin mediated iron transport to the bone marrow to support erythropoiesis ly2787106 is a fully humanized mab with high affinity for human hepcidin this phase 1 study evaluated the safety pk pd and efficacy effects on serum iron panel iron ferritin transferrin saturation tsat soluble transferrin receptor reticulocyte hemoglobin reticulocytosis and hemoglobin hb of ly2787106 in cancer pts with anemia methods a 3 3 design was used in the dose

showed that ly2787106 was well tolerated when given q3w had a short half life 7 days and transiently increased serum iron this supported more frequent weekly dosing in part b treatment emergent aes

ly2787106 but none had hypersensitivity reactions the ly2787106 pk profile was consistent with reported pk characteristics of a mab the profile included a small clearance of 0 032 l h associated with limited volume of distribution resulting in a terminal half life of 7 days ly2787106 pk was independent of time and dose and exposure linear in the 0 3 10 mg kg dose range pd data indicated that ly2787106 administration led to a mean maximum 3 48 fold increase 90 ci 2 5 4 8 from baseline in serum iron at the highest dose 10 mg kg in parts a and b serum iron increase was maximal 24 48 hours post dose but returned to baseline within a week after dosing the increase in serum iron paralleled a transient increase in tsat at dose levels of 1 3 and 10 mg kg this translated to a transient increase in mean ratio of reticulocyte count relative to baseline at 2 weeks post dose in pts who received 10 mg kg q3w but hb levels remained relatively unchanged in part b a 0 5 g dl increase in hb from baseline albeit transient was seen in 4 pts at week 12 2 pts each cohort no consistent increase in reticulocytes or changes in iron profiles were seen in these pts factors that may have confounded the limited change in hb and reticulocyte profiles included the myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy concomitantly given during the study comorbidities and study related blood draws as expected ly2787106 administration led to increased hepcidin concentrations secondary to hepcidin binding neutralization by ly2787106 and hepcidin release in response to iron increase conclusions this is the first clinical trial of a fully humanized mab against hepcidin ly2787106 was well tolerated in cancer pts with anemia targeting the hepcidin ferroportin pathway by neutralizing hepcidin resulted in transient iron mobilization and reticulocyte count relative to baseline thus supporting the role of hepcidin in iron regulation and anemia pathogenesis disclosuresvadhan raj eli lilly

10.1101/238899,abstract as an image based single cell transcriptomics approach multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization merfish allows hundreds to thousands of rna species to be identified counted and localized in individual cells while preserving the native spatial context of rnas in merfish rnas are identified via a combinatorial labeling approach that encodes rna species with error robust barcodes followed by sequential rounds of single molecule fish smfish to read out these barcodes the accuracy of rna identification relies on spatially separated signals from individual rna molecules which limits the density of rnas that can be measured and makes the multiplexed imaging of a large number of high abundance rnas challenging here we report an approach that combines merfish and expansion microscopy to substantially increase the total density of rnas that can be measured using this approach we demonstrate accurate identification and counting of rnas with a near 100 detection efficiency in a 130 rna library composed of many high abundance rnas the total density of which is more than 10 fold higher than previously reported in parallel we demonstrate the combination of merfish with immunofluorescence these advances increase the versatility of merfish and will facilitate its application of a wide range of biological problems,unknown,1345
10.1161/atvb.33.suppl_1.a11,introductionwhile it is realized that inflammation plays a key role in the development of atherosclerosis the underlying mechanism of how t cells directly or indirectly trigger and propagate the disease process is not forthcoming this is because there is no knowledge of what constitutes an atherogenic t cell and how to isolate it new and innovative ideas are needed hypothesiswe reason that t cells are antigen specific and identification of the atherogenic antigenic epitopes of an autoantigen should lead us to identification of the atherogenic t cells themselves methods since the t cell receptor only recognizes a short peptide of the antigen in association with major histocompatibility complex mhc proteins our focus was directed towards elucidating the peptides that form a ligand with mhc class ii proteins and bind to atherogenic t cells it has been known that oxidized low density lipoprotein apob100 heat shock protein 60 and β2 glycoprotein i are the major atherogenic antigens because different mhc haplotypes have different binding motifs of peptide sequences and most atherosclerosis experiments are carried out in the h 2 b apoe mice we searched for h 2 b binding motifs along the entire amino acid sequence of murine apob100 according to the prediction model of liu et al apoe mice fed western diet wd for 8 weeks were immunized with the identified peptides in cfa mice were boosted in 2 weeks and 3 weeks later were sacrificed and the aortic trees were isolated the extent of atherosclerosis was assessed via en face staining of the aortic samples with oil red o resultswe identified eighteen such peptides six of which were selected for synthesis two of the peptides peptide6 p6 and peptide3 p3 induced strong proliferative responses in immunized mice but only p6 was atherogenic in enhancing development of atherosclerosis in wd fed and p6 immunized mice the proliferative t cells were of the cd4 type producing il 17 ifnγ as well as il 10 and il 13 t cell clones were derived from p6 primed mice and adoptive transfer of these clones into wd fed recipients also showed enhanced atherosclerosis conclusionsour identification of a t cell epitope of apob100 allows cloning of a population of peptide specific atherogenic t cells,unknown,2248
10.1093/jrs/feaa026,abstractin the aftermath of the liberian civil war and the signing of the final peace agreement among the warring factions the international community and host countries of liberian refugees in the west african sub region disproportionately pursued the policy of refugee repatriation to liberia at the expense of other options such as integration and resettlement as a solution for the refugee problem using the liberian refugees in the buduburam refugee camp in ghana as a qualitative case study this research argues that the policy of repatriation has largely failed the research arrives at this conclusion via the use of focus group interviews of a cross section of remaining liberian refugees in the buduburam camp the research discovered that while the refugees are discontent with their current circumstances in ghana they are hesitant to return home due to unfavourable homeland conditions the combination of both unfavourable host and homeland conditions constitutes intervening obstacles that mitigate against repatriation and thus put the ghana based liberian refugees in a dilemma the research recommends the option of integration as a viable option that should be legislated and institutionalized to attract the necessary buy in from the remaining refugees,unknown,1268

10.5194/bg-2016-4,abstract estuaries are sources of nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 to the atmosphere however our present knowledge of n2o and ch4 emissions from estuaries in the tropics is very limited because data is scarce in this study we present first measurements of dissolved n2o and ch4 from two estuaries in a peat dominated region of north western borneo two campaigns during the dry seaso n in june 2013 and during the wet season in march 2014 were conducted in the estuaries of the rivers lupar and saribas median n2o concentrations ranged between 7 2 and 12 3 nmol l 1and were higher in the marine end member 13 0 7 0 nmol l 1 ch4 concentrations were low in the coastal ocean 3 6 0 2 nmol l 1 and higher in the estuaries medians between 12 2 and 64 0 nmol l 1 the respiration of abundant organic matter and presumably anthropogenic input caused a slight eutrophication which did not lead to hypoxia or enhanced n2o concentrations however generally n2o concentrations were not related to dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations thus the use of an emission factor for the calculation of n2o emissions from the inorganic nitrogen load leads to an overestimation of the flux from the lupar and saribas estuaries n2o was negatively correlated with salinity during the dry season which suggests a riverine source in contrast n2o concentrations during the wet season were not correlated with salinity but locally enhanced within the estuaries implying that there were additional estuarine sources during the wet i e monsoon season estuarine ch4 distributions were not driven by freshwater input but rather by tidal variations both n2o and ch4 concentrations were more variable during the wet season we infer that the wet season dominates the variability of the n2o and ch4 concentrations and subsequent emissions from tropical estuaries thus we speculate that any changes the southeast asian monsoon system will lead to changes in the n2o and ch4 emissions from these systems we also suggest that the ongoing cultivation of peat soil in borneo is likely to increase n2o emissions from these estuaries while the effect on ch4 remains uncertain,unknown,2136

10.2118/99-13-60,abstractdevelopment of a retrograde condensate reservoir requires accurate well productivity predictions for a capital commitment to gas processing facilities historically fussell 1 identified that liquids condensing in the reservoir will result in a substantial productivity impairment a single well model which included a hydraulic fracture as part of the grid system was developed to perform sensitivities for well test interpretation and to predict long term performance interesting results were obtained the productivity of fractured wells was not impaired to the degree expected radial modelling confirmed the results obtained by fussell current simulation technique allows for direct modelling of a hydraulic fracture instead of using an equivalent well bore radius the distribution of pressure drawdown and condensate dropout around a hydraulic fracture results in limited productivity impairment the methodology used and the results obtained are described introductionthis work was originally completed to forecast production from wells in a new field which was being developed in the deep basin area of alberta canada this study was comprised of geological review pvt characterization numerous well test sensitivities as well as simulating the effects of condensate dropout on well productivity the ultimate objective of this work was to make a nomination for a sour gas plant this paper concentrates on the most important technical point which is that the productivity of wells which are hydraulically fractured may not be as adversely affected by condensate precipitation as was previously reported however in any actual study there are a significant number of factors which are derived from different disciplines within petroleum engineering which must be integrated we have therefore placed our main results within an abbreviated outline of the process used in solving an actual field problem in the authors opinion this is more valuable to practicing engineers as much as possible the material is presented chronologically so as to follow the development of the technical work material is presented under the following major headings geological review pvt characterization model construction well test modelling effects of condensate dropout and conclusions originally this work was completed for a single well which was later expanded to include other wells in other pools only the work done on the first well analysed is presented and does not apply universally to the area geological reviewthe main objective of this phase of the study was to develop a quantitative reservoir description this included porosity permeability water saturation and layering heterogeneity since this was a new play relatively little information was available on this zone the lithology of the sandstone in this well was derived from a core description overall the sand comprises interbedded dark grey black shaley siltstones and light grey dolomitic sandstones the shaley siltstones occur in beds that range in thickness from centimetres inch to metres 3 to 6 ft the sandstone occurs in beds 1 10 of a metre 4 in to metres 3 to 6 ft thick layering can be a major consideration in the design of a simulation particularly for secondary recovery,unknown,3239

10.1075/ijolc.00001.pal,abstract while the newly arriving millennial generation of cultural linguists was maturing boomers and generation xer s were developing a theory of cognitive linguistics in an environment hostile to both induction and science two decades of mechanical deductive models from the intellectual not political right were followed by two more decades of linguistic subversion of science from the postmodernist left in spite of these astringent intellectual currents inductive linguistic science thrived in the last two decades of the 20th century and attracted attention from other disciplines including anthropology philosophy psychology and esl the branch that we call cognitive linguistics did so largely by investigating imagery usage symbolic networks and systems of metaphor some researchers from the social and linguistic sciences found it useful to shift the focus away from the universal imagistic attentional processes employed by cognitive linguists and over to culturally defined sources of imagery this resulted in the retooling of linguistic relativism under the rubric of cultural linguistics just as the first millennials were entering grad schools at the advent of the 21st century in addition to motivating cross linguistic and cross cultural studies of metaphors and cultural models the shift has been productive in revealing links between culture ideology and grammar it is argued that the single most pregnant and distinguishing concept in cultural linguistics is that of the scenario and it is hoped that the millennial generation will continue to develop and employ it in cross linguistic studies in this paper we demonstrate its application to cultural grammar,unknown,1678

10.1101/2022.02.22.481293,a bstract we present neural models of one of humans most astonishing cognitive feats the ability to interpret linguistic instructions in order to perform novel tasks with just a few practice trials models are trained on a set of commonly studied psychophysical tasks and receive linguistic instructions embedded by transformer architectures pre trained on natural language processing our best performing models can perform an unknown task with a performance of 80 correct on average based solely on linguistic instructions i e 0 shot learning and 90 after 3 learning updates we found that the resulting neural representations capture the semantic structure of interrelated tasks even for novel tasks allowing for the composition of practiced skills in unseen settings finally we also demonstrate how this model can generate a linguistic description of a task it has identified using motor feedback which when communicated to another network leads to near perfect performance 95 to our knowledge this is the first experimentally testable model of how language can structure sensorimotor representations to allow for task compositionality,unknown,1136
